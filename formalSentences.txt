 Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks  During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe  These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett  The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate  Waters commented: Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd   While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio  Thorgerson recalled that he sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there  He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him  Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience  Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth . Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US   In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space  In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals , in their newly finished 24-track studio  The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell 's political fable Animal Farm . The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep  Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station , over which they superimposed an image of a pig   The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis  Although Gilmour was largely responsible for Dogs, which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part  Pigs on the Wing . Wright commented: It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there  Mason recalled: Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately  Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album  Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals ; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering  Animals was the first Pink Floyd album with no writing credit for Wright, who said: This was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me   Released in January 1977, Animals peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three  NME described the album as one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music, and Melody Maker ' s Karl Dallas called it  uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific   Pink Floyd performed much of Animals during their  In the Flesh  tour  It was their first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band  Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance  On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to quit  At the Montreal Olympic Stadium , a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them  The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish   In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album  The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former  Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album  Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II . This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett  At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person   During the recording of The Wall , the band became dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution and fired him  Gilmour said that Wright was dismissed as he hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little  According to Mason, Wright would sit in on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'. Waters said the band agreed that Wright would either have to have a long battle or agree to leave quietly after the album was finished; Wright accepted the ultimatum and left   The Wall was supported by Pink Floyd's first single since Money,  Another Brick in the Wall (Part II) , which topped the charts in the US and the UK  The Wall was released on 30 November 1979 and topped the Billboard chart in the US for 15 weeks, reaching number three in the UK  It is number three on the RIAA 's list of the all-time Top 100 albums, with 23 million certified units sold in the US  The cover, with a stark brick wall and band name, was the first Pink Floyd album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis   Gerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the Wall tour  He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline, including the Mother, the Ex-wife and the Schoolmaster  Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances  Relationships within the band reached an all-time low; their four Winnebagos parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre  Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band  Wright returned as a paid musician, making him the only band member to profit from the tour, which lost about $600,000 (US$1,687,335 in 2019 dollars ).  The Wall was adapted into a film, Pink Floyd – The Wall . The film was conceived as a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved impractical to film  Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach  The animated sequences remained, but scenes were acted by actors with no dialogue  Waters was screentested, but quickly discarded and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the role of Pink  Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall ' s storyline as bollocks  Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed  Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd – The Wall premièred in the UK in July 1982   In 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks , originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall  With the onset of the Falklands War , Waters changed direction and began writing new material  He saw Margaret Thatcher 's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father  Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall . Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire  Michael Kamen , a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall , mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright  The tension within the band grew  Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure  After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions   Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album  With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure  Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself  Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US  Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album  Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused  Gilmour later commented: I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut . Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece  Loder viewed The Final Cut as essentially a Roger Waters solo album   Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face , in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters  He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd  Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity , which went almost unnoticed upon its release  Mason released his second solo album, Profiles , in August 1985   Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking , Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite  He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments  O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager  He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs  Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations  Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd  Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him  He went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd a spent force creatively   When Waters' lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name  Gilmour responded with a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist  The sides reached an out-of-court agreement, finalised on Gilmour's houseboat the Astoria on Christmas Eve 1987  In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members   In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason . There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions  Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence would make us stronger legally and musically, and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of $11,000   Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria , moored along the River Thames . The group found it difficult to work without Waters' creative direction; to write lyrics, Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough , eventually choosing Anthony Moore . Wright and Mason were out of practice; Gilmour said they had been destroyed by Roger, and their contributions were minimal   A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987  Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut , designed the album cover  To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle . The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US  Waters commented: I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate  Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: Roger's criticisms are fair  It's not a band album at all  Q magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album   Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name  Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral  Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice  Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them  As Pink Floyd toured North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances  Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig . Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design  The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall .  For several years Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event  In January 1993, they began working on a new album, The Division Bell , returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material  After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs  Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about 25 ideas   Contractually, Wright was not a member of the band, and said, It came close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album  However, he earned five co-writing credits, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here . Another songwriter credited on the album was Gilmour's future wife, Polly Samson . She helped him write several tracks, including  High Hopes , a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, pulled the whole album together, according to Ezrin  They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the album's orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned  Writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork  Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island ; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger  Eager to avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse , Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring  The Division Bell reached number 1 in the UK and the US, and spent 51 weeks on the UK chart   Pink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California , before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour  They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety  The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994  Mason published a memoir, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd , in 2004   On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24 years, at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park , London  The reunion was arranged by Live 8 organiser Bob Geldof ; after Gilmour declined the offer, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters  About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed  In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event   They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios  The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of the event  At the beginning of their performance of Wish You Were Here, Waters told the audience:  quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd  At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage  Waters called him back, and the band shared a group hug  Images of the hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity   Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136 million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only  However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen: The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in  It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that  It's just ... I've been there, I've done it  In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica , which declared: Patience for fans in mourning  The news is official  Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased  Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: It's over ... I've had enough  I'm 60 years old ... it is much more comfortable to work on my own  Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite   Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60  His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended  Wright said: The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death  Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire  Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to music  On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert Madcap's Last Laugh at the Barbican Centre in London  Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed the Barrett compositions  Bike  and Arnold Layne, and Waters performed a solo version of his song Flickering Flame   Wright died of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65  His former bandmates paid tributes to his life and work; Gilmour said: In the welter of arguments about who or what was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten  He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound  A week after Wright's death, Gilmour performed Remember a Day from A Saucerful of Secrets , written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute to him on BBC Two's Later .. with Jools Holland . Keyboardist Keith Emerson released a statement praising Wright as the backbone of Pink Floyd   On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation  The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, with an audience of approximately 200  In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour performed Comfortably Numb at Waters' performance of The Wall at the London O2 Arena on 12 May 2011, singing the choruses and playing the two guitar solos  Mason also joined, playing tambourine for  Outside the Wall  with Gilmour on mandolin   On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd ...   , reissuing the back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including Experience and Immersion multi-disc multi-format editions  The albums were remastered by James Guthrie , co-producer of The Wall . In November 2015, Pink Floyd released a limited edition EP, 1965: Their First Recordings , comprising six songs recorded prior to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn .  In 2012, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album  They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and generally harness studio technology  Waters was not involved  Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound  Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was   The Endless River was released on 7 November 2014, the second Pink Floyd album distributed by Parlophone following the release of the 20th anniversary editions of The Division Bell earlier in 2014  Though it received mixed reviews, it became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK and debuted at number one in several countries  The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997  Gilmour said The Endless River would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end  There was no supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was impossible without Wright  In 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were done and that to reunite without Wright would be wrong  Mason said in 2018 that Gilmour and Waters continued to be at loggerheads   In November 2016, Pink Floyd released a box set, The Early Years 1965–1972 , comprising outtakes, live recordings, remixes, and films from their early career  This was followed in December 2019 by The Later Years , compiling Pink Floyd's work after Waters' departure  The set includes a remixed version of A Momentary Lapse of Reason with more contributions by Wright and Mason, and an expanded reissue of the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder . In 2018, Mason formed a new band, Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets , to perform Pink Floyd's early material  The band includes Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet and longtime Pink Floyd collaborator Guy Pratt . They toured Europe in September 2018 and North America in 2019  Waters joined the band at the New York Beacon Theatre to perform vocals for  Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun .  Considered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, appearing at UFO Club and Middle Earth (club) . According to Rolling Stone : By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock , blues, country , folk , and electronic music . Released in 1968, the song Careful with That Axe, Eugene helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group  Other genres attributed to the band are space rock , experimental rock , acid rock , proto-prog , experimental pop (while under Barrett), psychedelic pop , and psychedelic rock . O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:  Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype  Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging ... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own ... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance   During the late 1960s, the press labelled their music psychedelic pop, progressive pop and progressive rock ; the band gained a following as a psychedelic pop group  In 1968, Wright commented on Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group  We never saw ourselves that way ... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun ... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted ... the emphasis ... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation  Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: There wasn't anything 'grand' about it  We were laughable  We were useless  We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental' ... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing  Interstellar Overdrive  for hours and hours  Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s   —Alan di Perna, in Guitar World , May 2006  Rolling Stone critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as integral to Pink Floyd's sound, and described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen . Rolling Stone named him the 14th greatest guitarist of all time  In 2006, Gilmour said of his technique:  fingers make a distinctive sound ... aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows . Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis .  In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures  According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on Money,  Time  and  Comfortably Numb  cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog  Brown described the Time solo as a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato  Brown described Gilmour's phrasing as intuitive and perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist  Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... singing sustain ... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold  It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade   Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound  Their second single, See Emily Play premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967  During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator . The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect  In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system   Waters experimented with the VCS 3 synthesiser on Pink Floyd pieces such as  On the Run ,  Welcome to the Machine , and  In the Flesh  . He used a binson echorec 2 delay effect on his bass-guitar track for  One of These Days .  Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut . Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect  The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones  The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears   Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee . In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder 's film More . The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets , the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter  While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni 's film Zabriskie Point , the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month  Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week  Eventually he used only three of their recordings  One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called The Violent Sequence, later became Us and Them, included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon . In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée , for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds . They composed the material in about a week at the Château d'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart   Regarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems  From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London  Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground   To celebrate the launch of the London Free School 's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of the Roundhouse , attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull . In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers , mirrors and stretched condoms . After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation  On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace , London  Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise  In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called  Moonhead .  In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows  In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named Algie  Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour  The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall . The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a 40 feet (12 m) high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience  They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story  They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story  One striking feature of the tour was the performance of Comfortably Numb  While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall  When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him  Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician  A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech   During the Division Bell Tour , an unknown person using the name Publius posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album  White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius  During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word enigma in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage  Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band   Marked by Waters' philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as purveyors of a distinctively dark vision  Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference  Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd  Author George Reisch described Meddle 's psychedelic opus, Echoes, as built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy , and collaboration with others  Despite having been labelled the gloomiest man in rock, author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist , dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics   Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's  Have a Cigar  deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives  The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes Pink is the name of one of the band members  According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce, a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience   Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd  Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War . Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours  Their film score, Obscured by Clouds , dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing  Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here : The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling  Waters commented: it's about none of us really being there ... should have been called Wish We Were Here .  O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music  Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall , with the lyrics to Comfortably Numb: I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye  I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone  Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, Jugband Blues: I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here   Author Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the powerful sounds and suggestive themes of Dark Side with The Wall 's portrayal of artistic alienation  He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm . Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: If you didn't care what happened to me  And I didn't care for you, then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each  The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia , the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines   The album's characters include the Dogs, representing fervent capitalists, the Pigs, symbolising political corruption, and the Sheep, who represent the exploited  Croskery described the Sheep as being in a state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity, a false consciousness . The Dog, in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation  Waters used Mary Whitehouse as an example of a Pig; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society  At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: You know that I care what happens to you  And I know that you care for me too  However, he also acknowledges that the Pigs are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a Dog who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them   —Waters, quoted in Harris, 2005  O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of Dark Side of the Moon 's  Brain Damage  with Karl Marx 's theory of self-alienation ; there's someone in my head, but it's not me  The lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's Welcome to the Machine suggest what Marx called the alienation of the thing ; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others  Allusions to the alienation of man's species being can be found in Animals ; the Dog reduced to living instinctively as a non-human  The Dogs become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a necessary and defensible position in a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle wrote Detmer  Alienation from others is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of The Wall .  War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of The Wall , and a recurring theme in the band's music  Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from Corporal Clegg (1968),  Free Four  (1972),  Us and Them  (1973),  When the Tigers Broke Free  and  The Fletcher Memorial Home  from The Final Cut (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled A Requiem for the Postwar Dream . The themes and composition of The Wall express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women   Waters' lyrics to The Dark Side of the Moon dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity  He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition  However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it an exhortation ... to embrace the positive and reject the negative  Reisch described The Wall as less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness  The Wall 's protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making  After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is crazy, over the rainbow  He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: have I been guilty all this time  Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him  He then stands trial for showing feelings of an almost human nature, further exacerbating his alienation of species being  As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault , Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies, contribute to his angst, according to Reisch   Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time  They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37 9 million albums sold in the US since 1993  The Sunday Times Rich List , Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million   In 2004, MSNBC ranked Pink Floyd number 8 on their list of The 10 Best Rock Bands Ever  In the same year, Q named Pink Floyd as the biggest band of all time according to a points system that measured sales of their biggest album, the scale of their biggest headlining show and the total number of weeks spent on the UK album chart  Rolling Stone ranked them number 51 on their list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  VH1 ranked them number 18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  Colin Larkin ranked Pink Floyd number 3 in his list of the 'Top 50 Artists of All Time', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist's albums included in his All Time Top 1000 Albums . In 2008, the head rock and pop critic of The Guardian , Alexis Petridis , wrote that the band occupy a unique place in progressive rock, stating, Thirty years on, prog is still persona non grata Only Pink Floyd—never really a prog band, their penchant for long songs and 'concepts' notwithstanding—are permitted into the 100 best album lists   Pink Floyd have won several awards  In 1981 audio engineer James Guthrie won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Album for The Wall , and Roger Waters won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Original Song Written for a Film in 1983 for Another Brick in the Wall from The Wall film . In 1995, Pink Floyd won the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for  Marooned . In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music; Waters and Mason attended the ceremony and accepted the award  They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010   Pink Floyd have influenced numerous artists  David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and The Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to  Dogs  from Animals . Other bands and artists who cite them as an influence include Queen , Radiohead , Steven Wilson , Marillion , Queensrÿche , Nine Inch Nails , the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins . Pink Floyd were an influence on the neo-progressive rock subgenre which emerged in the 1980s  The English rock band Mostly Autumn fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd in their sound   Pink Floyd were admirers of the Monty Python comedy group, and helped finance their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail . In 2016, Pink Floyd became the second band (after the Beatles ) to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail . In May 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of Pink Floyd's first single, an audio-visual exhibition, Their Mortal Remains , opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London  The exhibition featured analysis of cover art, conceptual props from the stage shows, and photographs from Mason's personal archive  It was extended for two weeks beyond its planned closing date of 1 October   Books  Documentaries     Powderfinger were an Australian rock band formed in Brisbane in 1989  From 1992 until their break-up in 2010, the line-up consisted of vocalist Bernard Fanning , guitarists Darren Middleton and Ian Haug , bass guitarist John Collins and drummer Jon Coghill . The group's third studio album Internationalist peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart in September 1998  They followed with four more number-one studio albums in a row: Odyssey Number Five (September 2000), Vulture Street (July 2003), Dream Days at the Hotel Existence (June 2007) and Golden Rule (November 2009). Their Top Ten hit singles are  My Happiness  (2000),  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind  (2003) and  Lost and Running  (2007). Powderfinger earned a total of eighteen ARIA Awards , making them the second-most awarded band behind Silverchair . Ten Powderfinger albums and DVDs certified multiple- platinum , with Odyssey Number Five – their most successful album – achieving eightfold platinum certification for shipment of over 560,000 units   After the release of their first DVD, These Days: Live in Concert (September 2004), and the compilation album Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 (November 2004), the group announced a hiatus in 2005  The June 2007 announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with Silverchair, Across the Great Divide tour , followed the release of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . Powderfinger were also involved in various philanthropic causes  In 2005, they performed at a WaveAid concert in Sydney , to help raise funds for areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake . Another performance at the Sydney Opera House in October 2007 raised funds for breast cancer victims and their families  One aim of their Across the Great Divide Tour was to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia , and awareness of the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children  In April 2010 Powderfinger announced that they would be breaking up after their Sunsets Farewell Tour , declaring it would be their last ever as they had musically said everything they wanted to say  On 13 November 2010, they played their last concert, signifying their disbandment  In November the following year, rock music journalist Dino Scatena and Powderfinger published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band   On 23 May 2020, the band reformed for a one-off livestreamed charity performance, One Night Lonely .  Powderfinger were formed in 1989 by Steven Bishop (ex-the Eternal) on drums, John Collins (the Eternal) on bass guitar, and Ian Haug (the Vibrants, the Fossils) on guitar and vocals  The Eternal, the Vibrants, and the Fossils were other Brisbane-based outfits  All three members of Powderfinger were students at Brisbane Grammar School – a private school in Spring Hill – and they started as a cover band playing pub rock classics by the Rolling Stones , the Doors , Led Zeppelin , Steppenwolf , Rodriguez , and Neil Young . The band's name comes from Young's song of the same name . Despite their popularity in Brisbane, when playing a heavy metal gig in Newcastle, New South Wales , in 1990, Powderfinger were booed off stage   After completing secondary education, Collins and Haug attended the University of Queensland , where the latter met Bernard Fanning in an economics class – and learned that Fanning had similar interests in music and could sing  Fanning took over the role of lead vocals from Haug and also provided guitar and harmonica  Late in 1990, Jon Coghill – another university student with Fanning and Haug – replaced Bishop on drums, which was described as a mutual leaving  Bishop later worked in London-based bands based in London, UK , before returning to Brisbane where he was a member of Moonjuice and then the Haymakers  Powderfinger's final line-up change was in 1992 with the addition of Darren Middleton (The Pirates) on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals  Powderfinger initially performed cover versions of other artists' songs, but gradually developed by writing and performing their own material   In August 1992, the group self-funded a seven-track self-titled extended play , also known as the Blue EP , on their own Finger label, and the album was distributed by MDS  It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane  The EP has an early version of  Save Your Skin , co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton, and Fanning; it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a single from their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears . Their second EP, Transfusion , was issued in September 1993 and distributed by Polydor Records . At that time, Simon McKenzie of Time Off noted they were hoping the major label will put a bit of weight behind the disc, but it's not as though they've signed a record deal or anything  McKenzie felt the EP showed they were wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, but is it also a reaction against the sixties tags they've been stuck with . The five tracks include Reap What You Sow, which reached the No  1 spot on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart , replacing Nirvana 's  Heart-Shaped Box . The group recorded their first music video , for Reap What You Sow; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos  After the EP's success, the group were signed by Polydor   In January 1994, Powderfinger performed on the Big Day Out Tour (see 1994 line-up ). On 18 July that year, they released their debut studio album, Parables for Wooden Ears , under Polydor  According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane , it featured complex, meticulously crafted rock but was somewhat ponderous and sombre, which did little to fulfil the promise displayed on Transfusion . The album was produced by Tony Cohen ( Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds , The Cruel Sea ), and Fanning later described it as the band's dark dark days  It received limited radio coverage  Supporting the album's release, the band toured heavily, appearing at the Livid and Homebake music festivals  Powderfinger supported United States visitors Pantera on that group's Driven Downunder Tour '94  Another Australian support act on the tour was Newcastle-formed band Silverchair . Three singles were released from Powderfinger's debut album –  Tail ,  Grave Concern , and  Save Your Skin  – but none appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top 50  Following the album's release and lukewarm reception, in April 1995, the band recorded at Melbourne's Metropolis Studio with Lachlan Magoo Goold ( Regurgitator ) and in July released a five-track EP, Mr Kneebone .  The band's second studio album, Double Allergic , was issued on 2 September 1996; it peaked at No  4 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified triple  platinum by ARIA for shipment of 210,000 units by 2007  It was co-produced by Tim Whitten and the group  McFarlane felt this album was more self-assured and textured consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene, alongside the likes of You Am I , Spiderbait , Silverchair, Regurgitator and Tumbleweed  was full of accessible, spirited rock  Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll noted  revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves  Powderfinger's reason to be is to create songs strong enough for the band and audience to play and hear months or years down the line  Four singles were released from the album –  Pick You Up ,  D.A.F. ,  Living Type , and  Take Me In . Take Me In was released as a video single featuring several other music videos by the group  FasterLouder, a music review web site, recalled that when Double Allergic was released in 1996, it showed the band were here for the long haul to become arguably one of the best of the decade  In 1997 the album was issued in Canada and the group toured North America to promote it   On 7 September 1998, Powderfinger released their third studio album, Internationalist , which peaked at No  1 and spent 101 weeks in the Top 50 of the ARIA Albums Chart; it was produced by Nick DiDia ( Rage Against the Machine , Pearl Jam ). AllMusic 's Jonathan Lewis had mixed feelings about the album  He was enchanted by its lead single,  The Day You Come , however the rest of the album didn't measure up except for some fine tracks in Don't Wanna Be Left Out and Already Gone  Nevertheless, by 2007 the album had shipped over 350,000 copies and was certified five times platinum domestically, and had reached European audiences  Internationalist was the first Powderfinger album to win any ARIA Music Awards . At the 1999 ceremony it won Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Kevin Wilkins), and The Day You Come won Single of the Year   Passenger , another single from Internationalist , was nominated for three additional categories in the following year . The band was both praised and criticised for their political views on Internationalist . In a November 1998 interview with Benedict Watts of Juice Magazine , Haug said that political messages in The Day You Come were not something they were just preaching about, but rather were something they saw as a responsibility   Powderfinger's fourth studio album, Odyssey Number Five , was released on 4 September 2000, and also peaked at No  1. Entertainment Weekly ' s Marc Weingarten provided a positive review and found the group prove that there's still terrain left to be explored guitar rock ... melancholy is the default mode ... can be as prim as Travis or as mock-grandiose as Oasis . However, Allmusic's Dean Carlson was more negative, seeing the album as little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American grunge . Odyssey Number Five is Powderfinger's most commercially successful album, shipping 560,000 copies and certified eight times platinum by 2004  It also appeared on the New Zealand Albums Chart at No  15  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 , the group won Album of the Year, Highest Selling Album, Best Rock Album, Best Cover Art (by Wilkins), and Best Group   Two of Odyssey Number Five ' s tracks featured on film soundtracks:  These Days , written for Two Hands (1999), and  My Kind of Scene  in Mission: Impossible 2 (2000). Singles from the album are My Kind of Scene,  My Happiness ,  Like a Dog , and the double A-side  The Metre / Waiting for the Sun . My Happiness, which peaked at No  4 in Australia and No  7 in New Zealand, is the group's highest-charting single in both countries  At the ARIA Awards ceremony, My Happiness won Single of the Year, and other songs were nominated in various categories  Their tracks received votes from national radio station Triple J 's listeners on annual Hottest 100 lists: These Days, Already Gone,  Good-Day Ray , and Passenger were ranked in 1999 , and My Happiness and My Kind of Scene in 2000 . In 2009, These Days was voted at No  21 and My Happiness at No  27 in the Hottest 100 of all time, placing them as second- and fourth-highest Australian tracks after the Hilltop Hoods '  The Nosebleed Section  and Hunters &amp; Collectors '  Throw Your Arms Around Me , respectively   Powderfinger's Vulture Street was released on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No  1 in Australia, while in New Zealand it reached No  17  Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for the location of the band's first recording room in West End , Brisbane  The Sydney Morning Herald ' s music critic Bernard Zuel approved of a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album with a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect; he felt it had Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut album  Simon Evans of musicOMH described the group as having opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs  Middleton explained that the band's aim was to get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things we grew up loving, which was Bowie , Zeppelin , Kiss ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s  We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it's a very old-school-sounding record  It's all the old amps, we used old guitars and recorded to tape , of course  It's fairly organic in that sense  Vulture Street won four ARIA Awards in 2003 : Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design). Singles issued from the album are:  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind ,  Since You've Been Gone ,  Love Your Way , and  Sunsets . Tracks were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004 .  In September 2004 the group issued their first live album, These Days: Live in Concert , initially as a CD , and followed in October with a two-disc DVD . One single,  Stumblin' , which had appeared on Vulture Street , was issued as a live version  In late October they released a compilation album, Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 , which included many of their singles from the first four albums as well as non-singles Thrilloilogy and Belter, and a re-release of These Days  These Days, although never officially released as a single, was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll of 1999  The album also included two new songs:  Bless My Soul  and Process This, although only Bless My Soul was released as a single  Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger appeared at the WaveAid fundraising concert in January 2005 in Sydney, to raise funds for aid organisations working in the disaster-affected areas  Fanning, as a member of The Wrights , sang lead vocals on  Evie, part 2  at the concert  The Wrights released a studio version in March as a single with some of the proceeds going to tsunami relief efforts   After the WaveAid concert, from early 2005, Powderfinger had a period of hiatus  During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the personal front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife  Middleton's side project, Drag , had issued an EP, Gas Food Lodging , in 2002  Zombos Reviews found the EP was full of well-written jangly pop, and has some rather nice ballads  Their debut album, The Way Out , recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July, was a tad disappointing ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads  Everything's tastefully arranged, and there's always nice melodies and harmonies  Collins and Haug formed The Predators with Powderfinger's former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals  The group released a six-track EP, Pick Up the Pace , in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia   In October 2005 Fanning issued his debut solo album, Tea &amp; Sympathy , which reached No  1 in Australia and No  11 in New Zealand  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 , Fanning won in four categories including Album of the Year for Tea &amp; Sympathy and Best Video for its lead single,  Wish You Well . Wish You Well was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll in 2005  At the end of 2006, Fanning toured in support of the album's release in the United Kingdom and North America; at its conclusion, Powderfinger resumed from their hiatus  Fanning compared his solo work to Powderfinger recordings, saying, when a problem came up in the studio, especially guitar-wise, I've always had Darren and Ian to call on  They could usually come up with something good  But I played all the guitar on it, and my abilities are fairly limited and that Powderfinger is my real job and I'm looking forward to doing it again   Powderfinger started recording their sixth studio album, Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , in January 2007; it was released on 2 June  Debuting at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart – their fourth to do so consecutively – it broke the Australian digital sales record with over 3,000 copies sold online  In general, reviewers did not rate it as highly as its predecessor Vulture Street , with Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun HiT describing it as No radical reinvention, no huge change in direction ... In a word: consistent  Zuel described it as Powderfinger's first dull album but the band as the biggest rock band in the country   Lost and Running , their first single for three years, had been issued in May, and reached No  5. A second single,  I Don't Remember , appeared in August  One song from the album,  Black Tears , was amended following concerns that it could prejudice a trial over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  Fanning stated that an alternative version would be on the album as a result of the concerns  On 18 August that year, Powderfinger performed a concert in Karratha as part of Triple J's AWOL Series  The band was supported by The Grates and Muph N Plutonic, and various local acts  While in Karratha, Fanning and Coghill visited Gumala Mirnuwarni, a local school in Roebourne that encourages children to stay in school   In June 2007 Powderfinger and Silverchair announced the nine-week Across the Great Divide tour to promote reconciliation with Indigenous Australians . From August to October that year the two groups toured all state capital cities as well as fourteen Australian regional centres, and included four performances in New Zealand  They performed 34 concerts in 26 towns across Australia, with an estimated total of 220,000 people in attendance  On 1 December, a triple-DVD set was released with the same title as the tour , with the Melbourne performances for both bands and backstage footage from the tour  The schedule consisted of three main parts, beginning with a supporting artist performing one set, followed by Silverchair and then Powderfinger playing the final set  The two bands united on stage during only three performances throughout the tour, including Daniel Johns (Silverchair) and Fanning sharing lead vocals on a cover version of The Who 's  Substitute  at one show in Sydney and two in Melbourne   Dream Days at the Hotel Existence was the recipient of the ARIA Award for Best Cover Art in 2007 . It was also nominated for Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Group, while Lost and Running received nominations for Single of the Year and Best Video  Powderfinger failed to win any of these awards, with tour mates Silverchair's Young Modern and  Straight Lines  obtaining all five  On 28 October at the ceremony, Powderfinger performed Lost and Running  The third single from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence ,  Nobody Sees , was released in December 2007  On 27 September 2008, Powderfinger performed (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind and AC/DC 's  Long Way to the Top  at the AFL Grand Final . Their song Drifting Further Away featured on Grey's Anatomy ' s fifth season in episode 13,  Stairway to Heaven , which aired on 21 January 2009   From mid-June 2009 Powderfinger worked with DiDia producing their seventh studio album, Golden Rule , which was issued on 13 November  The album peaked at No  1 on the ARIA albums chart – becoming their fifth studio album in a row to do so  The album's lead single,  All of the Dreamers , was released in September  Burn Your Name, the second single, followed in December  That same month the band performed at the 2009 Homebake festival after a 10-year absence  In late January they toured on the 2010 Big Day Out  The third single from the album, Sail the Widest Stretch, appeared in April   Also in April 2010, Powderfinger announced that after 21 years the group would disband following their Sunsets Farewell Tour in September and October that year:  With the completion of our last album, Golden Rule , we feel that we have said all that we want to say as a musical group  We firmly believe that it is our most complete and satisfying album and can't think of a better way to farewell our fans than with music that we all believe in and also with, hopefully, our best tour to date   Coghill told Australian Times that the final tour is going to be great fun, but it's also going to be sad  He confirmed that he had no plans to start a new band or for a solo project  Instead he intended to finish his degree,  nce I'm done with that, I might put the feelers out and see what's happening  I don't think I'd be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just to have a chance to keep playing  I'm just not keen to be off touring the world anymore  Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was These Days  On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, I'm on Your Side, as a fundraiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of major flooding in Queensland from December the previous year into January  The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause  On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, Footprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 2001–2011 , containing two new tracks  There was also a 2-disc release, Fingerprints &amp; Footprints – The Ultimate Collection , combining both Fingerprints and Footprints in one set  Also in November, Dino Scatena, together with the band, published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band . Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in October of the previous year, during the Sunsets Farewell Tour   Former Powderfinger member Bernard Fanning worked on his second solo album Departures during late 2012 in Los Angeles, with Joe Chiccarelli producing  It was released in June the following year and peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart  Middleton had relocated to Melbourne and worked with Red Door Sounds' Paul Annison – producer of Children Collide 's album Monument (April 2012). In December that year Middleton revealed that I’m halfway through a new record  Middleton's album, Translations , was released independently in November 2013  Around the same time Coghill was working as a journalist on the Gold Coast, while Collins was developing business projects in Queensland   In January 2013 Haug produced the second album, Sins of a Li'l Later Kiss , by Brisbane-based folk duo Cole and Van Dijk  He then joined the Church , replacing Marty Willson-Piper , and featured on their 2014 album Further/Deeper .  On the 23 May 2020, Powderfinger reformed for a one off, live-streamed YouTube charity performance titled, One Night Lonely with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue and Support Act  On 25 May, an EP of the performance was released   On 31 August 2020, Powderfinger confirmed the release of a compilation album of unreleased songs titled Unreleased (1998–2010) due on the 27th November 2020, which was preceded by the single Day by Day, released on 18 September   On 13 November 2020, Powderfinger released the second single preceding the release of the album Unreleased (1998-2010) Daybreak   Powderfinger's musical style includes hard rock and alternative music and, according to McFarlane, the band made its mark with an earthy, blues-based sound that combined soaring, 1970s-influenced riff-rock with 1990s studio technology  With the added textures of folk, country and a soulful groove, the band was able to head in any direction  Nimmervoll acclaimed them as one of Australia's most popular radio-friendly rock bands which produced music the rest of Australia embraced  McFarlane was partially disappointed with their debut 1994 album Parables for Wooden Ears compared to their earlier EP Transfusion . Their 1996 album, Double Allergic , was more self-assured and textured and consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene  It revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves according to Nimmervoll   In a November 2007 interview with Paul Cashmere of the website Undercover, Middleton stated that a couple of songs they had initially written for Vulture Street were just too Odyssey Number Five based, and that the first track, Rockin' Rocks, was probably the start of where we were heading with the album  Cashmere stated that the album was the toughest heard Powderfinger sound  Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger's more recent albums, and described Vulture Street as a rawer, louder album in comparison to Odyssey Number Five ; it highlighted Fanning's talent as a lyricist and he stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut  Zuel also stated that there is a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, and described On My Mind as having  AC/DC meatiness, and Love Your Way as acoustic tumbling into weaving Zeppelin lines  In his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , Zuel described it as  high-gloss and muscular framework, and stated that that was what American radio considers serious rock   Compared with the relatively lean, agile sound they've perfected up to now, this is Powderfinger as the footballer who in the off-season spends his time in the gym and emerges buff and beefy  The problem is he has bulk but has traded in his nimbleness   Clayton Bolger of AllMusic stated in his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence that Powderfinger largely revisit the sound of their Internationalist album, leaving behind much of the glam and swagger of 2003's Vulture Street . He commented on Fanning's commanding and distinctive vocals, the twin-guitar attack of Middleton and Haug, Collins' innovative basslines, and the powerhouse drum work of Coghill  Nimmervoll described Golden Rule as Powderfinger back to its essence  They’d experimented with the sound, tried different things with the songwriting process and recorded in America with different producers  was recorded at home, the band reunited with American Nick DiDia, who had previously worked with the band during the classic era, producing Internationalist , Odyssey Number 5 and Vulture Street . They also wrote the songs as a team, with Bernard responsible for the bulk of the lyrics  The album was recorded in the same spirit, as close to the live sound as a studio album could be   Powderfinger were active in supporting causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances  In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children's Hospital on 24 November  They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts Custard and You Am I to also appear on the steps of the Sydney Opera House . The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled Farewell to the World , was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people  In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005  The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area  The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected   The song  Black Tears  from the album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence originally had the lyric An island watchhouse bed, a black man's lying dead, which sparked fears that it might prejudice the trial of the former Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  The band claimed that the song's lyrics primarily dealt with the climbing of Uluru by tourists despite requests from the Indigenous people of the area to respect their sacred sites and not climb  The original version of the song was retracted from the album, and replaced with an alternative version with the criticised material removed  The legal team for Hurley, who was charged with manslaughter over the death of Mulrunji in 2004, had referred the song to the Attorney-General of Queensland , Kerry Shine , in their attempt at altering the track  One of Hurley's lawyers, Glen Cranny, stated that the content and proposed timing of the song's release raises some serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley's trial  Powderfinger's band manager, Paul Piticco , stated that Fanning had confirmed that a line in the song was related to the case  However, he added that the lyric in question could refer to a watchhouse in The Bahamas or something   In June 2007, Powderfinger and Silverchair announced their combined Across the Great Divide Tour, which promoted Reconciliation Australia , a foundation helping to improve the welfare of the Indigenous people of Australia, and to show both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation  Reconciliation Australia increased the awareness of the 17-year difference in life expectancy between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous children of Australia  In October that year, during Breast Cancer Awareness Month , Powderfinger performed another concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House  This concert was for invitees only – breast cancer patients, survivors, and their families were eligible to attend  Powderfinger performed alongside Silverchair, Missy Higgins , and other artists to an audience of 700  The concert was filmed and later broadcast as a MAX Session on Foxtel channel MAX on 3 November   For the Sunsets Farewell Tour in September 2010, the band promoted another Indigenous cause, the Yalari organisation  The organisation provides Indigenous children with opportunities to get a proper education  In January 2011, following the Queensland flood disaster , reported that Powderfinger would not reform for a benefit concert, but the band instead donated a never-before released track, I'm on Your Side, to help raise money for the victims   Throughout their recording career, Powderfinger consisted of five members: Bernard Fanning as lead vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist, and harmonicist; John Collins as bass guitarist; Ian Haug, originally the lead vocalist until Fanning joined, played lead guitars; Darren Middleton on co-lead guitars, keyboards, backing vocals, and occasional lead vocals; Jon Coghill as drummer and percussionist  Their lineup remained stable from 1992 until their disbandment in November 2010  Steven Bishop had been the group's original drummer, but had left to focus on his studies  The band refers to one another by nicknames, including Collins as JC and Coghill as Cogsy   Powderfinger have collaborated with various artists throughout their career: Pianist Benmont Tench played on Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . For touring or session work, auxiliary musicians used include Alex Pertout on percussion, Duane Billings on percussion, and Lachlan Doley on keyboards  For their second album, Double Allergic , the group enlisted Tim Whitten as producer  The group approached American expatriate Nick DiDia as their producer for Internationalist , and recorded with him at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne  DiDia also produced the two albums which followed  In 2007 Rob Schnapf , producer for Beck , was asked to produce Dream Days at the Hotel Existence in Los Angeles  DiDia returned for Golden Rule . Powderfinger's first music video, for the song Reap What You Sow in 1993, was directed by David Barker, an award-winning director  Film companies who directed other videos for the group include Fifty Fifty Films and Head Pictures   Powderfinger was highly successful in the Australian recording industry, being a recipient of the industry's flagship awards, the ARIA Music Awards, 18 times from 47 nominations – the third-highest behind Silverchair's 21 wins from 49 nominations and John Farnham 's 20 wins from 56 nominations  Powderfinger's most successful year was 2001 , when they won six awards from eight nominations for Odyssey Number Five and its related singles  These Days and My Happiness were ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 lists in 1999 and 2000 respectively, and 21 other Powderfinger tracks have ranked on lists in other years   In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Powderfinger were announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for their role as Influential Artists   General  Specific     Joseph Maurice Ravel ( French:  ; 7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor  He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy , although both composers rejected the term  In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer   Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire ; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal  After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of modernism, baroque , neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz . He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development  He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known   A slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries  Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music  Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration  Some of his piano music, such as Gaspard de la nuit (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chloé (1912) require skilful balance in performance   Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public  From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision   Ravel was born in the Basque town of Ciboure , France, near Biarritz , 18 kilometres (11 mi) from the Spanish border  His father, Pierre-Joseph Ravel , was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in Versoix near the Franco-Swiss border  His mother, Marie, née Delouart, was Basque but had grown up in Madrid  In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status – Marie was illegitimate and barely literate – but the marriage was a happy one  Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early internal combustion engine and a notorious circus machine, the Whirlwind of Death, an automotive loop-the-loop that was a major attraction until a fatal accident at Barnum and Bailey's Circus in 1903   Both Ravel's parents were Roman Catholics ; Marie was also something of a free-thinker , a trait inherited by her elder son  He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born  The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born  (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession ) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music  Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him  The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods   Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general  In later life, Ravel recalled, Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music  My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age  There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father   When he was seven, Ravel started piano lessons with Henry Ghys, a friend of Emmanuel Chabrier ; five years later, in 1887, he began studying harmony , counterpoint and composition with Charles-René, a pupil of Léo Delibes . Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy  Charles-René found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort  Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by Schumann , variations on a theme by Grieg and a single movement of a piano sonata  They survive only in fragmentary form   In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist Ricardo Viñes , who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music  The two shared an appreciation of Wagner , Russian music, and the writings of Poe , Baudelaire and Mallarmé . At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov . This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy , as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan , also heard during the Exposition   Émile Decombes took over as Ravel's piano teacher in 1889; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance  Aged fourteen, he took part in a concert at the Salle Érard along with other pupils of Decombes, including Reynaldo Hahn and Alfred Cortot .  With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the Conservatoire de Paris . In November 1889, playing music by Chopin , he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eugène Anthiome  Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student  Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer  The musicologist Arbie Orenstein writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period of immense growth   ... from adolescence to maturity   In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot , for piano, and Émile Pessard , for harmony  He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from Bériot but, in the words of the musicologist Barbara L. Kelly , he was only teachable on his own terms  His later teacher Gabriel Fauré understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s  Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes  His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: Sérénade grotesque , for piano, and Ballade de la Reine morte d'aimer, a mélodie setting a poem by Roland de Marès (both 1893).  Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Viñes and Cortot were  It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer  From this point he concentrated on composition  His works from the period include the songs Un grand sommeil noir and D'Anne jouant de l'espinette to words by Paul Verlaine and Clément Marot , and the piano pieces Menuet antique and Habanera (for four hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the Rapsodie espagnole . At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie , who was earning a living as a café pianist  Ravel was one of the first musicians – Debussy was another – who recognised Satie's originality and talent  Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them of inestimable value   In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with Fauré, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with André Gedalge . Both these teachers, particularly Fauré, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer  As Ravel's course progressed, Fauré reported a distinct gain in maturity   ... engaging wealth of imagination  Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, Théodore Dubois , who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook  Consequently, according to a fellow student, Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi , he was a marked man, against whom all weapons were good  He wrote some substantial works while studying with Fauré, including the overture Shéhérazade and a violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900  As a former student he was allowed to attend Fauré's classes as a non-participating auditeur until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903   In 1899 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: Pavane pour une infante défunte ( Pavane for a dead princess). It was originally a solo piano work, commissioned by the Princesse de Polignac . In 1897 he conducted the first performance of the Shéhérazade overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics  One described the piece as a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School and called Ravel a mediocrely gifted debutant   ... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years, if he works hard  Another critic, Pierre Lalo , thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven . Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic   From the start of his career, Ravel appeared calmly indifferent to blame or praise  Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine  The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own, perfectionist and severely self-critical  At twenty years of age he was, in the words of the biographer Burnett James, self-possessed, a little aloof, intellectually biased, given to mild banter  He dressed like a dandy and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour  Orenstein comments that, short in stature, light in frame and bony in features, Ravel had the appearance of a well-dressed jockey, whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect  During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century, Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day; from his mid-thirties he was clean-shaven   Around 1900 Ravel and a number of innovative young artists, poets, critics and musicians joined together in an informal group; they came to be known as Les Apaches (The Hooligans), a name coined by Viñes to represent their status as artistic outcasts  They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War, and members stimulated one another with intellectual argument and performances of their works  The membership of the group was fluid, and at various times included Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla as well as their French friends   Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy  Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued for more than ten years  In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique . It divided musical opinion  Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece  The Apaches were loud in their support  The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them   Debussy was widely held to be an impressionist composer – a label he intensely disliked  Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre  Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not  Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship  Ravel wrote that Debussy's genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition  For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy   ... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of symbolism . During the first years of the new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece Jeux d'eau (1901), the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works  Nichols calls the quartet at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence   The two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons  Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other  Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom  Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people  The public tension led to personal estrangement  Ravel said, It's probably better for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons  Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift  In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer Emma Bardac . Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante Misia Edwards and the opera star Lucienne Bréval , contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband    During the first years of the new century Ravel made five attempts to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome , past winners of which included Berlioz , Gounod , Bizet , Massenet and Debussy  In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition  In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy , the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies  In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a furore . He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable  The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu , was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received  L'affaire Ravel became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire   Among those taking a close interest in the controversy was Alfred Edwards , owner and editor of Le Matin , for which Lalo wrote  Edwards was married to Ravel's friend Misia; the couple took Ravel on a seven-week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905, the first time he had travelled abroad   By the latter part of the 1900s Ravel had established a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra  He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed  There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters  The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestrated 1910), Une barque sur l'océan (1906, from the 1905 piano suite Miroirs ), the Habanera section of Rapsodie espagnole (1907–08), Ma mère l'Oye (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911, orchestrated 1912), Alborada del gracioso (from Miroirs , orchestrated 1918) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).  Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them  Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent  Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters  He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound  When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity  The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams , who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08  Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner   ... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto   Vaughan Williams's recollections throw some light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation  Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels, Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women  By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange . Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual  Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry ; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery   Ravel's first concert outside France was in 1909  As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Société des Concerts Français, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation   The Société Nationale de Musique , founded in 1871 to promote the music of rising French composers, had been dominated since the mid-1880s by a conservative faction led by Vincent d'Indy . Ravel, together with several other former pupils of Fauré, set up a new, modernist organisation, the Société Musicale Indépendente, with Fauré as its president  The new society's inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Fauré's song cycle La chanson d'Ève , Debussy's piano suite D'un cahier d'esquisses , Zoltán Kodály 's Six pièces pour piano and the original piano duet version of Ravel's Ma mère l'Oye . The performers included Fauré, Florent Schmitt , Ernest Bloch , Pierre Monteux and, in the Debussy work, Ravel  Kelly considers it a sign of Ravel's new influence that the society featured Satie's music in a concert in January 1911   The first of Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy L'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911  The work had been completed in 1907, but the manager of the Opéra-Comique, Albert Carré , repeatedly deferred its presentation  He was concerned that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the Opéra-Comique's audience  The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular   In 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered  The first, to the orchestrated and expanded version of Ma mère l'Oye , opened at the Théâtre des Arts in January  The reviews were excellent: the Mercure de France called the score absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature  The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the Queen's Hall , London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year  The Times praised the enchantment of the work   ... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing  New York audiences heard the work in the same year  Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was Adélaïde ou le langage des fleurs , danced to the score of Valses nobles et sentimentales , which opened at the Châtelet in April  Daphnis et Chloé opened at the same theatre in June  This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete   Daphnis et Chloé was commissioned in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes . Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine , and designer, Léon Bakst . Fokine had a reputation for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music  This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music  There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work  It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London  The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere   Ravel composed little during 1913  He collaborated with Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky 's unfinished opera Khovanshchina , and his own works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier . In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of The Rite of Spring . Stravinsky later said that Ravel was the only person who immediately understood the music  Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande .  When Germany invaded France in 1914 Ravel tried to join the French Air Force . He considered his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator, but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint  While waiting to be enlisted, Ravel composed Trois Chansons , his only work for a cappella choir, setting his own texts in the tradition of French 16th-century chansons  He dedicated the three songs to people who might help him to enlist  After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist, Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915, when he was forty  Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend's courage: at his age and with his name he could have had an easier place, or done nothing  Some of Ravel's duties put him in mortal danger, driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment  At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother's failing health  His own health also deteriorated; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems, underwent a bowel operation following amoebic dysentery in September 1916, and had frostbite in his feet the following winter   During the war, the Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française was formed by Saint-Saëns, Dubois, d'Indy and others, campaigning for a ban on the performance of contemporary German music  Ravel declined to join, telling the committee of the league in 1916, It would be dangerous for French composers to ignore systematically the productions of their foreign colleagues, and thus form themselves into a sort of national coterie: our musical art, which is so rich at the present time, would soon degenerate, becoming isolated in banal formulas  The league responded by banning Ravel's music from its concerts   Ravel's mother died in January 1917, and he fell into a horrible despair, compounding the distress he felt at the suffering endured by the people of his country during the war  He composed few works in the war years  The Piano Trio was almost complete when the conflict began, and the most substantial of his wartime works is Le tombeau de Couperin , composed between 1914 and 1917  The suite celebrates the tradition of François Couperin , the 18th-century French composer; each movement is dedicated to a friend of Ravel's who died in the war   After the war, those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina  As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, Ravel's emotional equilibrium, so hard won in the previous decade, had been seriously compromised  His output, never large, became smaller  Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era  Fauré wrote to him, I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly  It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor  Ravel was offered the Legion of Honour in 1920, and although he declined the decoration, he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie's protégés Les Six as an establishment figure  Satie had turned against him, and commented, Ravel refuses the Légion d'honneur, but all his music accepts it  Despite this attack, Ravel continued to admire Satie's early music, and always acknowledged the older man's influence on his own development  Ravel took a benign view of Les Six, promoting their music, and defending it against journalistic attacks  He regarded their reaction against his works as natural, and preferable to their copying his style  Through the Société Musicale Indépendente, he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries  The Société presented concerts of recent works by American composers including Aaron Copland , Virgil Thomson and George Antheil and by Vaughan Williams and his English colleagues Arnold Bax and Cyril Scott .  Orenstein and Zank both comment that, although Ravel's post-war output was small, averaging only one composition a year, it included some of his finest works  In 1920 he completed La valse , in response to a commission from Diaghilev  He had worked on it intermittently for some years, planning a concert piece, a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz, mingled with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, fatal whirling  It was rejected by Diaghilev, who said, It's a masterpiece, but it's not a ballet  It's the portrait of a ballet  Ravel heard Diaghilev's verdict without protest or argument, left, and had no further dealings with him  Nichols comments that Ravel had the satisfaction of seeing the ballet staged twice by other managements before Diaghilev died  A ballet danced to the orchestral version of Le tombeau de Couperin was given at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in November 1920, and the premiere of La valse followed in December  The following year Daphnis et Chloé and L'heure espagnole were successfully revived at the Paris Opéra   In the post-war era there was a reaction against the large-scale music of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss . Stravinsky, whose Rite of Spring was written for a huge orchestra, began to work on a much smaller scale  His 1923 ballet score Les noces is composed for voices and twenty-one instruments  Ravel did not like the work (his opinion caused a cooling in Stravinsky's friendship with him) but he was in sympathy with the fashion for dépouillement – the stripping away of pre-war extravagance to reveal the essentials  Many of his works from the 1920s are noticeably sparer in texture than earlier pieces  Other influences on him in this period were jazz and atonality . Jazz was popular in Parisian cafés, and French composers such as Darius Milhaud incorporated elements of it in their work  Ravel commented that he preferred jazz to grand opera , and its influence is heard in his later music  Arnold Schönberg 's abandonment of conventional tonality also had echoes in some of Ravel's music such as the Chansons madécasses (1926), which Ravel doubted he could have written without the example of Pierrot Lunaire . His other major works from the 1920s include the orchestral arrangement of Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition (1922), the opera L'enfant et les sortilèges to a libretto by Colette (1926), Tzigane (1924) and the Violin Sonata (1927).  Finding city life fatiguing, Ravel moved to the countryside  In May 1921 he took up residence at Le Belvédère, a small house on the fringe of Montfort-l'Amaury , 50 kilometres (31 mi) west of Paris, in the Yvelines département . Looked after by a devoted housekeeper, Mme Revelot, he lived there for the rest of his life  At Le Belvédère Ravel composed and gardened, when not performing in Paris or abroad  His touring schedule increased considerably in the 1920s, with concerts in Britain, Sweden, Denmark, the US, Canada, Spain, Austria and Italy   Arbie Orenstein  After two months of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting  His fee was a guaranteed minimum of $ 10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes  He appeared with most of the leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities  Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary  At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York, the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat  Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed, You know, this doesn't happen to me in Paris  Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel's international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe's house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon . Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity  He commented that the critics' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, when they called him the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion   The last composition Ravel completed in the 1920s, Boléro , became his most famous  He was commissioned to provide a score for Ida Rubinstein 's ballet company, and having been unable to secure the rights to orchestrate Albéniz 's Iberia , he decided on an experiment in a very special and limited direction   ... a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of orchestral tissue without music  Ravel continued that the work was one long, very gradual crescendo  There are no contrasts, and there is practically no invention except the plan and the manner of the execution  The themes are altogether impersonal  He was astonished, and not wholly pleased, that it became a mass success  When one elderly member of the audience at the Opéra shouted Rubbish  at the premiere, he remarked, That old lady got the message  The work was popularised by the conductor Arturo Toscanini , and has been recorded several hundred times  Ravel commented to Arthur Honegger , one of Les Six, I've written only one masterpiece – Boléro . Unfortunately there's no music in it   At the beginning of the 1930s Ravel was working on two piano concertos  He completed the Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand first  It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein , who had lost his right arm during the war  Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project: In a work of this kind, it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands  Ravel, not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand, demonstrated it with both hands  Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece, but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work  In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim, and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year  The critic Henry Prunières wrote, From the opening measures, we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us   The Piano Concerto in G major was completed a year later  After the premiere in January 1932 there was high praise for the soloist, Marguerite Long, and for Ravel's score, though not for his conducting  Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting; they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted   Igor Stravinsky  In October 1932 Ravel suffered a blow to the head in a taxi accident  The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition  As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia . Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score  Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée . The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription  Ravel composed no more after this  The exact nature of his illness is unknown  Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour , and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia , Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease . Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months  Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head   In 1937 Ravel began to suffer pain from his condition, and was examined by Clovis Vincent , a well-known Paris neurosurgeon  Vincent advised surgical treatment  He thought a tumour unlikely, and expected to find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing  Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view  After the operation there seemed to be an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma  He died on 28 December, at the age of 62   On 30 December 1937 Ravel was interred next to his parents in a granite tomb at Levallois-Perret cemetery , in north-west Paris  He was an atheist and there was no religious ceremony   Marcel Marnat 's catalogue of Ravel's complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned  Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries, it is nevertheless inflated by Ravel's frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra  The performable body of works numbers about sixty; slightly more than half are instrumental  Ravel's music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera and song cycles  He wrote no symphonies or church works   Ravel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy  Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert , Liszt and Chopin  He considered himself in many ways a classicist , often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary , to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies  The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata   Ravel to Vaughan Williams  Ravel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is an implied melodic outline in all vital music  His themes are frequently modal instead of using the familiar major or minor scales  As a result, there are few leading notes in his output  Chords of the ninth and eleventh and unresolved appoggiaturas , such as those in the Valses nobles et sentimentales , are characteristic of Ravel's harmonic language   Dance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the bolero and pavane, but also the minuet , forlane , rigaudon , waltz , czardas , habanera and passacaglia . National and regional consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to Hebraic , Greek , Hungarian and gypsy themes  He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired – Borodin , Chabrier, Fauré and Haydn , interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style  Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion, with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude   Ravel completed two operas, and worked on three others  The unrealised three were Olympia , La cloche engloutie and Jeanne d'Arc . Olympia was to be based on Hoffmann 's The Sandman ; he made sketches for it in 1898–99, but did not progress far  La cloche engloutie after Hauptmann 's The Sunken Bell occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912, Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works, except for a Symphonie horlogère which he incorporated into the opening of L'heure espagnole . The third unrealised project was an operatic version of Joseph Delteil 's 1925 novel about Joan of Arc . It was to be a large-scale, full-length work for the Paris Opéra, but Ravel's final illness prevented him from writing it   Ravel's first completed opera was L'heure espagnole (premiered in 1911), described as a comédie musicale  It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career  Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects  Edward Burlingame Hill found Ravel's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action, and commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage  Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity  The critic David Murray writes that the score glows with the famous Ravel tendresse .  The second opera, also in one act, is L'enfant et les sortilèges (1926), a fantaisie lyrique to a libretto by Colette  She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto  It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than L'heure espagnole , and the jazz elements and bitonality of much of the work upset many Parisian opera-goers  Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work  The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout   Although one-act operas are generally staged less often than full-length ones, Ravel's are produced regularly in France and abroad   A substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal  His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome  His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as a static, recitative-like vocal style, prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility  By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in Histoires naturelles . The same technique is highlighted in Trois poèmes de Mallarmé (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided  In the cycles Shéhérazade and Chansons madécasses , Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment   Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as Cinq mélodies populaires grecques , Deux mélodies hébraïques and Chants populaires . Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue , Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine  For three songs dating from 1914–15, he wrote his own texts   Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices  Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade , to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score   During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous  He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use  The critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote, In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a pp tam-tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another   For all Ravel's orchestral mastery, only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra: Rapsodie espagnole , La valse and the two concertos  All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in Daphnis et Chloé , or as a reworking of piano pieces, Alborada del gracioso and Une barque sur l'ocean , ( Miroirs ), Valses nobles et sentimentales, Ma mère l'Oye , Tzigane (originally for violin and piano) and Le tombeau de Couperin  In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms  Occasionally, as in the Alborada del gracioso , critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original   In some of his scores from the 1920s, including Daphnis et Chloé , Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six to eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility  His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points  In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures  The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of Mozart and Saint-Saëns, alongside use of jazz-like themes  The critics Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor comment that in the slow movement, one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented, the composer can truly be said to join hands with Mozart  The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, Boléro (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm   Ravel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann, Chabrier, Debussy and Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition . Orchestral versions of the last by Mikhail Tushmalov , Sir Henry Wood and Leo Funtek predated Ravel's 1922 version, and many more have been made since, but Ravel's remains the best known  Kelly remarks on its dazzling array of instrumental colour, and a contemporary reviewer commented on how, in dealing with another composer's music, Ravel had produced an orchestral sound wholly unlike his own   Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch from the striking simplicity of Ma mère l'Oye to the transcendental virtuosity of Gaspard de la nuit . Ravel's earliest major work for piano, Jeux d'eau (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later  When writing for solo piano, Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity  The authors of The Record Guide consider that works such as Gaspard de la Nuit and Miroirs have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself   Most of Ravel's piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges  Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing  It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in Alborada del gracioso   ... and the two outer movements of Gaspard de la nuit . Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale  This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in Gaspard de la nuit , Le gibet would bore the audience to death  Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing   Ravel's regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works; Menuet sur le nom de Haydn (1909), À la manière de Borodine (1912), À la manière de Chabrier (1913) and Le tombeau de Couperin all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically Ravellian manner  Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions: Listen to Le tombeau de Couperin and the complete ballet music for Ma mère L'Oye in the classic recordings conducted by André Cluytens , and the piano versions never sound quite the same again   Apart from a one-movement sonata for violin and piano dating from 1899, unpublished in the composer's lifetime, Ravel wrote seven chamber works  The earliest is the String Quartet (1902–03), dedicated to Fauré, and showing the influence of Debussy's quartet of ten years earlier  Like the Debussy, it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers, with more succinct melodies, fluently interchanged, in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour  The Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet (1905) was composed very quickly by Ravel's standards  It is an ethereal piece in the vein of the Pavane pour une infante défunte . Ravel also worked at unusual speed on the Piano Trio (1914) to complete it before joining the French Army  It contains Basque, Baroque and far Eastern influences, and shows Ravel's growing technical skill, dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello, blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own, in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson   Ravel's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920–22), the Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Fauré for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of Tzigane for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923–27). The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel's teacher, and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist Jelly d'Arányi . The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody  His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work  Ravel said that the violin and piano are essentially incompatible instruments, and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility  Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor consider the post-war sonatas rather laboured and unsatisfactory, and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel's pre-war chamber works   Ravel's interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on piano roll between 1914 and 1928, although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by Robert Casadesus , a better pianist  Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc  In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of Jeux d'eau played by Mark Hambourg , and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the Pavane pour une infante défunte and Ondine , and movements from the String Quartet, Le tombeau de Couperin and Ma mère l'Oye . Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public, and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works, some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor  A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as Conducted by the composer, although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton  Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a Boléro in 1930, and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist   Ravel declined not only the Légion d'honneur, but all state honours from France, refusing to let his name go forward for election to the Institut de France . He accepted foreign awards, including honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921, the Belgian Ordre de Léopold in 1926, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1928   After Ravel's death, his brother and legatee, Edouard, turned the composer's house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it  As of 2018 the maison-musée de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours   In his later years, Edouard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind  After his death in 1960, the estate passed through several hands  Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were  The British newspaper The Guardian reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair      Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns ( French:  ; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era . His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (Organ) Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886).  Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten  After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri , Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine , the official church of the French Empire . After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas   As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann , Liszt and Wagner , although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition  He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers  This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six , he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death   Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years  It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré , among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel . Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius   Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin  Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris , and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice , always considered himself a true Parisian  Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption (tuberculosis) on the first anniversary of his marriage  The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil , 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris   When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson  Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano  His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty , a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner . Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training  Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young  The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart  The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel , in a programme that included Mozart 's Piano Concerto in B ♭ ( K 450), and Beethoven 's Third Piano Concerto . Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher Alexandre Pierre François Boëly . From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of Bach , which was then little known in France   As a schoolboy Saint-Saëns was outstanding in many subjects  In addition to his musical prowess, he distinguished himself in the study of French literature, Latin and Greek, divinity, and mathematics  His interests included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life   In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire , France's foremost music academy  The director, Daniel Auber , had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative  Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist  His organ professor was François Benoist , whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam , César Franck , Charles Alkan , Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet . In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies  His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy , whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet   Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo . He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome , in 1852 but was unsuccessful  Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen , who made little mark during the rest of his career  In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile , for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize  The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).  On leaving the Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns accepted the post of organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville . The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year there were more than two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income  The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot , had been badly damaged in the aftermath of the French Revolution and imperfectly restored  The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered  With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E ♭ (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire . The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile   Among the musicians who were quick to spot Saint-Saëns's talent were the composers Gioachino Rossini , Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt , and the influential singer Pauline Viardot , who all encouraged him in his career  In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of La Madeleine , the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world   Although in later life he had a reputation for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner . Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions  He commented, I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character  They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me  But I am not, I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion   In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France  Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies  He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner  His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré , recalled in old age:  After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known  ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I had for him, throughout my life   Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager ). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals , with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school   In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome  Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer  He was once more unsuccessful  Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote:  We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy  We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing  I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity  But the other man, who is still a student, has that inner fire, inspiration, he feels, he can do things that can't be learnt and the rest he'll learn more or less  So I voted for him, sighing at the thought of the unhappiness that this failure must cause Saint-Saëns  But, whatever else, one must be honest   According to the musical scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his well-known bon mot about Saint-Saëns, He knows everything, but lacks inexperience (Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience). The winner, Victor Sieg , had a career no more notable than that of the 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency  The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation  He himself wrote, Art is intended to create beauty and character  Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it  In fact, it is very much better off when it does  The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul  The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius, and Bad music well written   While teaching at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of his energy into composing and performing, but after he left in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with vigour  In 1867 his cantata Les noces de Prométhée beat more than a hundred other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi . In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his Second Piano Concerto . Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s   In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine , professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music  Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out  Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war  During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871  With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals  Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society  The Société Nationale de Musique , with its motto, Ars Gallica , had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc , Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members   As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems , Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first poème symphonique was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872  In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged  La princesse jaune (The Yellow Princess), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique , Paris in June  It ran for five performances   Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother  In 1875, he surprised many by marrying  The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils  The marriage was not a success  In the words of the biographer Sabina Teller Ratner, Saint-Saëns's mother disapproved, and her son was difficult to live with  Saint-Saëns and his wife moved to the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince , in the Latin Quarter ; his mother moved with them  The couple had two sons, both of whom died in infancy  In 1878, the elder, André, aged two, fell from a window of the flat and was killed; the younger, Jean-François, died of pneumonia six weeks later, aged six months  Saint-Saëns and Marie-Laure continued to live together for three years, but he blamed her for André's accident; the double blow of their loss effectively destroyed the marriage   For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music  Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere  In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged  His four-act drame lyricque, Le timbre d'argent (The Silver Bell), to Jules Barbier 's and Michel Carré 's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production  The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances   The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition  Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died  He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities  After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all  He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted   In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila , his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire  Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation  Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892   Saint-Saëns was a keen traveller  From the 1870s until the end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries  His professional engagements took him most often to Germany and England; for holidays, and to avoid Parisian winters which affected his weak chest, he favoured Algiers and various places in Egypt   Saint-Saëns was elected to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878  In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday  On 28 July he disappeared from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say that he would not be returning  They never saw each other again  Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five  Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman  Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women  After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle  Marie told him, For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here   In the 1880s Saint-Saëns continued to seek success in the opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it was unthinkable that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera  He had two operas staged during the decade, the first being Henry VIII (1883) commissioned by the Paris Opéra  Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Saëns, normally a fluent, even facile composer, worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England  The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer's lifetime  When it was produced at Covent Garden in 1898, The Era commented that though French librettists generally make a pretty hash of British history, this piece was not altogether contemptible as an opera story   The open-mindedness of the Société Nationale had hardened by the mid-1880s into a dogmatic adherence to Wagnerian methods favoured by Franck's pupils, led by Vincent d'Indy . They had begun to dominate the organisation and sought to abandon its Ars Gallica ethos of commitment to French works  Bussine and Saint-Saëns found this unacceptable, and resigned in 1886  Having long pressed the merits of Wagner on a sometimes sceptical French public, Saint-Saëns was now becoming worried that the German's music was having an excessive impact on young French composers  His increasing caution towards Wagner developed in later years into stronger hostility, directed as much at Wagner's political nationalism as at his music   By the 1880s Saint-Saëns was an established favourite with audiences in England, where he was widely regarded as the greatest living French composer  In 1886 the Philharmonic Society of London commissioned what became one of his most popular and respected works, the Third (Organ) Symphony . It was premiered in London at a concert in which Saint-Saëns appeared as conductor of the symphony and as soloist in Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto , conducted by Sir Arthur Sullivan . The success of the symphony in London was considerable, but was surpassed by the ecstatic welcome the work received at its Paris premiere early the following year  Later in 1887 Saint-Saëns's drame lyrique Proserpine opened at the Opéra-Comique  It was well received and seemed to be heading for a substantial run when the theatre burnt down within weeks of the premiere and the production was lost   In December 1888 Saint-Saëns's mother died  He felt her loss deeply, and was plunged into depression and insomnia, even contemplating suicide  He left Paris and stayed in Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose   During the 1890s Saint-Saëns spent much time on holiday, travelling overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before  A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell through in 1893  He wrote one opera, the comedy Phryné (1893), and together with Paul Dukas helped to complete Frédégonde (1895) an opera left unfinished by Ernest Guiraud , who died in 1892  Phryné was well received, and prompted calls for more comic operas at the Opéra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring grand opera . His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement fantasia Africa (1891) and his Fifth (Egyptian) Piano Concerto , which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his début at the Salle Pleyel in 1846  Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother's tutelage and his public's long support   Among the concerts that Saint-Saëns undertook during the decade was one at Cambridge in June 1893, when he, Bruch and Tchaikovsky performed at an event presented by Charles Villiers Stanford for the Cambridge University Musical Society , marking the award of honorary degrees to all three visitors  Saint-Saëns greatly enjoyed the visit, and even spoke approvingly of the college chapel services: The demands of English religion are not excessive  The services are very short, and consist chiefly of listening to good music extremely well sung, for the English are excellent choristers  His mutual regard for British choirs continued for the rest of his life, and one of his last large-scale works, the oratorio The Promised Land , was composed for the Three Choirs Festival of 1913   In 1900, after ten years without a permanent home in Paris, Saint-Saëns took a flat in the rue de Courcelles, not far from his old residence in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré  This remained his home for the rest of his life  He continued to travel abroad frequently, but increasingly often to give concerts rather than as a tourist  He revisited London, where he was always a welcome visitor, went to Berlin, where until the First World War, he was greeted with honour, and travelled in Italy, Spain, Monaco and provincial France  In 1906 and 1909 he made highly successful tours of the United States, as a pianist and conductor  In New York on his second visit he premiered his Praise ye the Lord for double choir, orchestra and organ, which he composed for the occasion   Despite his growing reputation as a musical reactionary, Saint-Saëns was, according to Gallois, probably the only French musician who travelled to Munich to hear the premiere of Mahler 's Eighth Symphony in 1910  Nonetheless, by the 20th century Saint-Saëns had lost much of his enthusiasm for modernism in music  Though he strove to conceal it from Fauré, he did not understand or like the latter's opera Pénélope (1913), of which he was the dedicatee  In 1917 Francis Poulenc , at the beginning of his career as a composer, was dismissive when Ravel praised Saint-Saëns as a genius  By this time, various strands of new music were emerging with which Saint-Saëns had little in common  His classical instincts for form put him at odds with what seemed to him the shapelessness and structure of the musical impressionists, led by Debussy  Nor did the theories of Arnold Schönberg 's dodecaphony commend themselves to Saint-Saëns:  There is no longer any question of adding to the old rules new principles which are the natural expression of time and experience, but simply of casting aside all rules and every restraint  Everyone ought to make his own rules  Music is free and unlimited in its liberty of expression  There are no perfect chords, dissonant chords or false chords  All aggregations of notes are legitimate  That is called, and they believe it, the development of taste .  Holding such conservative views, Saint-Saëns was out of sympathy – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty  It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky 's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913  In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane   When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music during the First World War, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with their old teacher  They were privately concerned that their friend was in danger of looking foolish with his excess of patriotism, and his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy's En blanc et noir (1915): We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the cubist pictures  His determination to block Debussy's candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer's supporters  Saint-Saëns's response to the neoclassicism of Les Six was equally uncompromising: of Darius Milhaud 's polytonal symphonic suite Protée (1919) he commented, fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France   Saint-Saëns gave what he intended to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance as a result of the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities  These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German warships   In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut for a large invited audience; it was remarked that his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his personal bearing was admirable for a man of eighty-six  He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do  While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921  His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the cimetière du Montparnasse . Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881   In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Saëns in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians wrote:  Saint-Saëns is a consummate master of composition, and no one possesses a more profound knowledge than he does of the secrets and resources of the art; but the creative faculty does not keep pace with the technical skill of the workman  His incomparable talent for orchestration enables him to give relief to ideas which would otherwise be crude and mediocre in themselves ... his works are on the one hand not frivolous enough to become popular in the widest sense, nor on the other do they take hold of the public by that sincerity and warmth of feeling which is so convincing   Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saëns was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past  In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic D   C   Parker wrote, That Saint-Saëns knows Rameau   ... Bach and Handel , Haydn and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings  His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art   Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Saëns often favoured self-contained melodies  Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, supple and pliable, more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the phrase pattern AABB is characteristic  An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him  Grove observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring  In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar  Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although Grove points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works   The authors of the 1955 The Record Guide , Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor write that Saint-Saëns's brilliant musicianship was instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the fact that there are other forms of music besides opera  In the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary , Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Saëns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c.1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia  Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable  The Urbs Roma Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and thick and heavy in its effect  Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of fugal writing  The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ  It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune  The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Saëns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885). The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring motif treated in a Lisztian style of thematic transformation .  Saint-Saëns's four symphonic poems follow the model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the vulgar blatancy to which the earlier composer was prone  The most popular of the four is Danse macabre (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight  Saint-Saëns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation, but in this piece he featured the xylophone prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers  Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871) was composed soon after the horrors of the Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies  Rees rates Phaëton (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer's professed indifference to melody, and inspired in its depiction of the mythical hero and his fate  A critic at the time of the premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece  The last of the four symphonic poems, La jeunesse d'Hercule (Hercules's Youth, 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful  In the judgment of the critic Roger Nichols these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel   Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, Javot (1896), the score for the film L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), and incidental music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916  Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier .  Saint-Saëns was the first major French composer to write piano concertos  His First , in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the Second , in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works  The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary sonata form first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn cadenza . The scherzo second movement and presto finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist Zygmunt Stojowski commented that the work begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach  The Third Piano Concerto , in E ♭ (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines  The Fourth , in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second  It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos  According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns the Beethoven of France (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor  The work is known as the Egyptian concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in Luxor , and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing   The First Cello Concerto , in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section  It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by Pablo Casals and later players  The Second , in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections  It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saint-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult  There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's Second , in C major  The First, in A, was also completed in 1858  It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour  The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime  The Third , in B minor, written for Pablo de Sarasate , is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity  It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso , in A minor, Op  28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863  It changes from a wistful and tense opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, After a multi-stopped cadenza ... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major   Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde , Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques . During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work  The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior  In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics  Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune , which Harding describes as like Sullivan with a light French touch   Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s  In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content   ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable  Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models  From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs , which, like Massenet, he used sparingly  Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less variety of tempo within individual numbers  In a survey of recorded opera Alan Blyth writes that Saint-Saëns certainly learned much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of Aida , and Wagner, but from these excellent models he forged his own style   From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies , writing more than 140  He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder . Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (Persian Songs, 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (The Red Ash Tree, 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo ; others included Alphonse de Lamartine , Pierre Corneille , Amable Tastu , and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet  He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable  Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including Le lever du soleil sur le Nil (Sunrise over the Nile, 1898) and Hymne à la paix (Hymn to Peace, 1919), are for voice and orchestra  His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy .  Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios  Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein . He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence , of oratorio  He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra  In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre  In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Saëns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it   Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark  Nichols excepts the Étude en forme de valse (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique  Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed the French Beethoven, and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E ♭ (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas  He is not known even to have contemplated writing one  There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns's works for the piano are single short pieces  In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as Souvenir d'Italie (1887), Les cloches du soir (Evening bells, 1889) and Souvenir d'Ismaïlia (1895).  Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo  Some of them were written for use in church services – Offertoire (1853), Bénédiction nuptiale (1859), Communion (1859) and others  After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former   Saint-Saëns wrote more than forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years  One of the first of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, confident piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other cantabile . The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms  At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of baroque composers including Rameau and Lully .  Sabina Teller Ratner, 2005  In Ratner's view, the most important of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment  The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by Grove's Dictionary as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions  The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards  The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier  It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment  Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance  The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo   The woodwind sonatas are among the composer's last works  Ratner writes of them, The spare, evocative, classical lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement  Gallois comments that the Oboe Sonata begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of tarantella . For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata is the most important of the three: he calls it a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism amounting to a summary of the rest  The work contrasts a doleful threnody  in the slow movement with the finale, which pirouettes in 4/4 time, in a style reminiscent of the 18th century  The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata a model of transparency, vitality and lightness, containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation   The composer's most famous work, The Carnival of the Animals (1887), although far from a typical chamber piece, is written for eleven players, and is considered by Grove's Dictionary to be part of Saint-Saëns's chamber output  Grove rates it as his most brilliant comic work, parodying Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Rossini, his own Danse macabre and several popular tunes  He forbade performances of it during his lifetime, concerned that its frivolity would damage his reputation as a serious composer   Saint-Saëns was a pioneer in recorded music  In June 1904 The Gramophone Company of London sent its producer Fred Gaisberg to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the mezzo-soprano Meyriane Héglon in arias from Ascanio and Samson et Dalila , and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra). Saint-Saëns made more recordings for the company in 1919   In the early days of the LP record , Saint-Saëns's works were patchily represented on disc  The Record Guide (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of Danse Macabre , The Carnival of the Animals , the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works  In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD  The 2008 Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Saëns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets  Also listed are an early Mass, collections of organ music, and choral songs  A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Saëns's mélodies was released in 1997   With the exception of Samson et Dalila the operas have been sparsely represented on disc  A recording of Henry VIII was issued on CD and DVD in 1992  Hélène was released on CD in 2008  There are several recordings of Samson et Dalilah , under conductors including Sir Colin Davis , Georges Prêtre , Daniel Barenboim and Myung-Whun Chung .  Saint-Saëns was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1867 and promoted to Officier in 1884, and Grand Croix in 1913  Foreign honours included the British Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1902, and honorary doctorates from the universities of Cambridge (1893) and Oxford (1907).  In its obituary notice, The Times commented:  The death of M. Saint-Saëns not only deprives France of one of her most distinguished composers; it removes from the world the last representative of the great movements in music which were typical of the 19th century  He had maintained so vigorous a vitality and kept in such close touch with present-day activities that, though it had become customary to speak of him as the doyen of French composers, it was easy to forget the place he actually took in musical chronology  He was only two years younger than Brahms, was five years older than Tchaikovsky, six years older than Dvořák , and seven years older than Sullivan  He held a position in his own country's music certain aspects of which may be fitly compared with each of those masters in their own spheres   In a short poem, Mea culpa, published in 1890 Saint-Saëns accused himself of lack of decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were not for him  An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day  The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form  The critic Henry Colles , wrote, a few days after the composer's death:  In his desire to maintain the perfect equilibrium we find the limitation of Saint-Saëns's appeal to the ordinary musical mind  Saint-Saëns rarely, if ever, takes any risks; he never, to use the slang of the moment, goes off the deep end  All his greatest contemporaries did  Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and even Franck, were ready to sacrifice everything for the end each wanted to reach, to drown in the attempt to get there if necessary  Saint-Saëns, in preserving his equilibrium, allows his hearers to preserve theirs   Grove concludes its article on Saint-Saëns with the observation that although his works are remarkably consistent, it cannot be said that he evolved a distinctive musical style  Rather, he defended the French tradition that threatened to be engulfed by Wagnerian influences and created the environment that nourished his successors   Since the composer's death writers sympathetic to his music have expressed regret that he is known by the musical public for only a handful of his scores such as The Carnival of the Animals , the Second Piano Concerto, the Third Violin Concerto, the Organ Symphony, Samson et Dalila , Danse macabre and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso  Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio , the ballet Javotte , the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces  In 2004, the cellist Steven Isserlis said, Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself ... there are Masses, all of which are interesting  I've played all his cello music and there isn't one bad piece  His works are rewarding in every way  And he's an endlessly fascinating figure      The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975  Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years, they are regarded as one of the most groundbreaking acts in the history of popular music . They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians  Their fashion and hairstyles have been credited as a significant influence on punk image , and they are often associated with anarchism within music   The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten , guitarist Steve Jones , drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock . Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977  Under the management of Malcolm McLaren , the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain  Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single  God Save the Queen , attacking Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they precipitated the punk rock movement  It was banned not only by the BBC but also by nearly every independent radio station, making it the most heavily censored record in British history   The band's only album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols (1977)—a UK number one album—is a staple record of punk rock  In January 1978, at the end of their over-hyped and turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten announced the band's break-up  Over the next few months, the three remaining band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex Pistols' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle . Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen . Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock briefly reunited for a concert tour in 1996   The Sex Pistols have been recognised as an influence on various genres, including grunge , indie , thrash metal and rap . In 2004, Rolling Stone placed them No  58 on its list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols—the four original members plus Vicious—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum a piss stain   The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar  According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments they had stolen  Early line-ups of The Strand—sometimes known as The Swankers—also included Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass  The band members regularly hung out at two clothing shops on the King's Road in Chelsea , London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor's Acme Attractions (where Don Letts worked as manager) and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood 's Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die  McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme  It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the 50's rocker look associated with Marlon Brando . As John Lydon later observed, Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto  The shop became a focal point of the punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious , Marco Pirroni , Gene October , and Mark Stewart , among many others  Jordan , the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look   In early 1974, Jones asked McLaren to manage The Strand  Effectively agreeing, McLaren paid for their first formal rehearsal space  Glen Matlock , an art student who occasionally worked at 'Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die', was recruited as the band's regular bassist  In November, McLaren temporarily relocated to New York City  Before his departure, McLaren and Westwood had conceived a new identity for their shop: renamed Sex , it changed its focus from retro couture to S&amp;M -inspired anti-fashion , with a billing as Specialists in rubberwear, glamourwear &amp; stagewear  After informally managing and promoting the New York Dolls for a few months, McLaren returned to London in May 1975  Inspired by the punk scene that was emerging in Lower Manhattan —in particular by the radical visual style and attitude of Richard Hell , then with Television —McLaren began taking a greater interest in The Strand members   The group had been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes , and had performed publicly for the first time  Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale was kicked out of the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties  According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones &amp; His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group  When those plans fell through, McLaren, Rhodes and the band began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties  As described by Matlock, Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so what we used to do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer  For instance, former singer with boy band Slik and future Ultravox front man Midge Ure claims to have been approached by McLaren, but to have refused the offer  With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation   In August 1975, Bernard Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old King's Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes  Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook  According to Jones, He came in with green hair  I thought he had a really interesting face  I liked his look  He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins  John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart  When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper 's  I'm Eighteen  on the shop jukebox  Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks  During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe  These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett  The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate  Waters commented: Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd   While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio  Thorgerson recalled that he sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there  He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him  Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience  Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth . Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US   In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space  In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals , in their newly finished 24-track studio  The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell 's political fable Animal Farm . The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep  Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station , over which they superimposed an image of a pig   The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis  Although Gilmour was largely responsible for Dogs, which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part  Pigs on the Wing . Wright commented: It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there  Mason recalled: Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately  Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album  Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals ; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering  Animals was the first Pink Floyd album with no writing credit for Wright, who said: This was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me   Released in January 1977, Animals peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three  NME described the album as one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music, and Melody Maker ' s Karl Dallas called it  uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific   Pink Floyd performed much of Animals during their  In the Flesh  tour  It was their first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band  Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance  On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to quit  At the Montreal Olympic Stadium , a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them  The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish   In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album  The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former  Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album  Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II . This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett  At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person   During the recording of The Wall , the band became dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution and fired him  Gilmour said that Wright was dismissed as he hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little  According to Mason, Wright would sit in on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'. Waters said the band agreed that Wright would either have to have a long battle or agree to leave quietly after the album was finished; Wright accepted the ultimatum and left   The Wall was supported by Pink Floyd's first single since Money,  Another Brick in the Wall (Part II) , which topped the charts in the US and the UK  The Wall was released on 30 November 1979 and topped the Billboard chart in the US for 15 weeks, reaching number three in the UK  It is number three on the RIAA 's list of the all-time Top 100 albums, with 23 million certified units sold in the US  The cover, with a stark brick wall and band name, was the first Pink Floyd album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis   Gerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the Wall tour  He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline, including the Mother, the Ex-wife and the Schoolmaster  Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances  Relationships within the band reached an all-time low; their four Winnebagos parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre  Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band  Wright returned as a paid musician, making him the only band member to profit from the tour, which lost about $600,000 (US$1,687,335 in 2019 dollars ).  The Wall was adapted into a film, Pink Floyd – The Wall . The film was conceived as a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved impractical to film  Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach  The animated sequences remained, but scenes were acted by actors with no dialogue  Waters was screentested, but quickly discarded and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the role of Pink  Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall ' s storyline as bollocks  Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed  Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd – The Wall premièred in the UK in July 1982   In 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks , originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall  With the onset of the Falklands War , Waters changed direction and began writing new material  He saw Margaret Thatcher 's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father  Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall . Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire  Michael Kamen , a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall , mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright  The tension within the band grew  Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure  After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions   Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album  With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure  Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself  Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US  Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album  Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused  Gilmour later commented: I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut . Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece  Loder viewed The Final Cut as essentially a Roger Waters solo album   Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face , in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters  He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd  Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity , which went almost unnoticed upon its release  Mason released his second solo album, Profiles , in August 1985   Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking , Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite  He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments  O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager  He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs  Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations  Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd  Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him  He went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd a spent force creatively   When Waters' lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name  Gilmour responded with a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist  The sides reached an out-of-court agreement, finalised on Gilmour's houseboat the Astoria on Christmas Eve 1987  In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members   In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason . There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions  Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence would make us stronger legally and musically, and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of $11,000   Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria , moored along the River Thames . The group found it difficult to work without Waters' creative direction; to write lyrics, Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough , eventually choosing Anthony Moore . Wright and Mason were out of practice; Gilmour said they had been destroyed by Roger, and their contributions were minimal   A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987  Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut , designed the album cover  To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle . The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US  Waters commented: I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate  Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: Roger's criticisms are fair  It's not a band album at all  Q magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album   Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name  Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral  Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice  Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them  As Pink Floyd toured North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances  Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig . Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design  The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall .  For several years Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event  In January 1993, they began working on a new album, The Division Bell , returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material  After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs  Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about 25 ideas   Contractually, Wright was not a member of the band, and said, It came close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album  However, he earned five co-writing credits, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here . Another songwriter credited on the album was Gilmour's future wife, Polly Samson . She helped him write several tracks, including  High Hopes , a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, pulled the whole album together, according to Ezrin  They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the album's orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned  Writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork  Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island ; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger  Eager to avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse , Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring  The Division Bell reached number 1 in the UK and the US, and spent 51 weeks on the UK chart   Pink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California , before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour  They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety  The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994  Mason published a memoir, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd , in 2004   On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24 years, at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park , London  The reunion was arranged by Live 8 organiser Bob Geldof ; after Gilmour declined the offer, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters  About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed  In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event   They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios  The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of the event  At the beginning of their performance of Wish You Were Here, Waters told the audience:  quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd  At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage  Waters called him back, and the band shared a group hug  Images of the hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity   Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136 million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only  However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen: The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in  It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that  It's just ... I've been there, I've done it  In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica , which declared: Patience for fans in mourning  The news is official  Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased  Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: It's over ... I've had enough  I'm 60 years old ... it is much more comfortable to work on my own  Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite   Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60  His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended  Wright said: The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death  Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire  Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to music  On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert Madcap's Last Laugh at the Barbican Centre in London  Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed the Barrett compositions  Bike  and Arnold Layne, and Waters performed a solo version of his song Flickering Flame   Wright died of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65  His former bandmates paid tributes to his life and work; Gilmour said: In the welter of arguments about who or what was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten  He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound  A week after Wright's death, Gilmour performed Remember a Day from A Saucerful of Secrets , written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute to him on BBC Two's Later .. with Jools Holland . Keyboardist Keith Emerson released a statement praising Wright as the backbone of Pink Floyd   On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation  The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, with an audience of approximately 200  In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour performed Comfortably Numb at Waters' performance of The Wall at the London O2 Arena on 12 May 2011, singing the choruses and playing the two guitar solos  Mason also joined, playing tambourine for  Outside the Wall  with Gilmour on mandolin   On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd ...   , reissuing the back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including Experience and Immersion multi-disc multi-format editions  The albums were remastered by James Guthrie , co-producer of The Wall . In November 2015, Pink Floyd released a limited edition EP, 1965: Their First Recordings , comprising six songs recorded prior to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn .  In 2012, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album  They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and generally harness studio technology  Waters was not involved  Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound  Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was   The Endless River was released on 7 November 2014, the second Pink Floyd album distributed by Parlophone following the release of the 20th anniversary editions of The Division Bell earlier in 2014  Though it received mixed reviews, it became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK and debuted at number one in several countries  The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997  Gilmour said The Endless River would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end  There was no supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was impossible without Wright  In 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were done and that to reunite without Wright would be wrong  Mason said in 2018 that Gilmour and Waters continued to be at loggerheads   In November 2016, Pink Floyd released a box set, The Early Years 1965–1972 , comprising outtakes, live recordings, remixes, and films from their early career  This was followed in December 2019 by The Later Years , compiling Pink Floyd's work after Waters' departure  The set includes a remixed version of A Momentary Lapse of Reason with more contributions by Wright and Mason, and an expanded reissue of the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder . In 2018, Mason formed a new band, Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets , to perform Pink Floyd's early material  The band includes Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet and longtime Pink Floyd collaborator Guy Pratt . They toured Europe in September 2018 and North America in 2019  Waters joined the band at the New York Beacon Theatre to perform vocals for  Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun .  Considered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, appearing at UFO Club and Middle Earth (club) . According to Rolling Stone : By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock , blues, country , folk , and electronic music . Released in 1968, the song Careful with That Axe, Eugene helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group  Other genres attributed to the band are space rock , experimental rock , acid rock , proto-prog , experimental pop (while under Barrett), psychedelic pop , and psychedelic rock . O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:  Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype  Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging ... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own ... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance   During the late 1960s, the press labelled their music psychedelic pop, progressive pop and progressive rock ; the band gained a following as a psychedelic pop group  In 1968, Wright commented on Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group  We never saw ourselves that way ... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun ... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted ... the emphasis ... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation  Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: There wasn't anything 'grand' about it  We were laughable  We were useless  We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental' ... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing  Interstellar Overdrive  for hours and hours  Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s   —Alan di Perna, in Guitar World , May 2006  Rolling Stone critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as integral to Pink Floyd's sound, and described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen . Rolling Stone named him the 14th greatest guitarist of all time  In 2006, Gilmour said of his technique:  fingers make a distinctive sound ... aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows . Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis .  In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures  According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on Money,  Time  and  Comfortably Numb  cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog  Brown described the Time solo as a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato  Brown described Gilmour's phrasing as intuitive and perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist  Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... singing sustain ... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold  It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade   Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound  Their second single, See Emily Play premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967  During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator . The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect  In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system   Waters experimented with the VCS 3 synthesiser on Pink Floyd pieces such as  On the Run ,  Welcome to the Machine , and  In the Flesh  . He used a binson echorec 2 delay effect on his bass-guitar track for  One of These Days .  Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut . Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect  The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones  The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears   Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee . In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder 's film More . The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets , the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter  While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni 's film Zabriskie Point , the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month  Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week  Eventually he used only three of their recordings  One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called The Violent Sequence, later became Us and Them, included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon . In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée , for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds . They composed the material in about a week at the Château d'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart   Regarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems  From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London  Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground   To celebrate the launch of the London Free School 's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of the Roundhouse , attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull . In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers , mirrors and stretched condoms . After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation  On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace , London  Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise  In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called  Moonhead .  In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows  In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named Algie  Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour  The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall . The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a 40 feet (12 m) high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience  They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story  They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story  One striking feature of the tour was the performance of Comfortably Numb  While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall  When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him  Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician  A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech   During the Division Bell Tour , an unknown person using the name Publius posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album  White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius  During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word enigma in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage  Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band   Marked by Waters' philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as purveyors of a distinctively dark vision  Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference  Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd  Author George Reisch described Meddle 's psychedelic opus, Echoes, as built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy , and collaboration with others  Despite having been labelled the gloomiest man in rock, author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist , dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics   Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's  Have a Cigar  deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives  The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes Pink is the name of one of the band members  According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce, a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience   Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd  Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War . Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours  Their film score, Obscured by Clouds , dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing  Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here : The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling  Waters commented: it's about none of us really being there ... should have been called Wish We Were Here .  O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music  Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall , with the lyrics to Comfortably Numb: I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye  I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone  Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, Jugband Blues: I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here   Author Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the powerful sounds and suggestive themes of Dark Side with The Wall 's portrayal of artistic alienation  He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm . Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: If you didn't care what happened to me  And I didn't care for you, then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each  The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia , the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines   The album's characters include the Dogs, representing fervent capitalists, the Pigs, symbolising political corruption, and the Sheep, who represent the exploited  Croskery described the Sheep as being in a state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity, a false consciousness . The Dog, in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation  Waters used Mary Whitehouse as an example of a Pig; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society  At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: You know that I care what happens to you  And I know that you care for me too  However, he also acknowledges that the Pigs are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a Dog who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them   —Waters, quoted in Harris, 2005  O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of Dark Side of the Moon 's  Brain Damage  with Karl Marx 's theory of self-alienation ; there's someone in my head, but it's not me  The lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's Welcome to the Machine suggest what Marx called the alienation of the thing ; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others  Allusions to the alienation of man's species being can be found in Animals ; the Dog reduced to living instinctively as a non-human  The Dogs become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a necessary and defensible position in a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle wrote Detmer  Alienation from others is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of The Wall .  War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of The Wall , and a recurring theme in the band's music  Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from Corporal Clegg (1968),  Free Four  (1972),  Us and Them  (1973),  When the Tigers Broke Free  and  The Fletcher Memorial Home  from The Final Cut (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled A Requiem for the Postwar Dream . The themes and composition of The Wall express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women   Waters' lyrics to The Dark Side of the Moon dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity  He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition  However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it an exhortation ... to embrace the positive and reject the negative  Reisch described The Wall as less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness  The Wall 's protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making  After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is crazy, over the rainbow  He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: have I been guilty all this time  Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him  He then stands trial for showing feelings of an almost human nature, further exacerbating his alienation of species being  As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault , Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies, contribute to his angst, according to Reisch   Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time  They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37 9 million albums sold in the US since 1993  The Sunday Times Rich List , Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million   In 2004, MSNBC ranked Pink Floyd number 8 on their list of The 10 Best Rock Bands Ever  In the same year, Q named Pink Floyd as the biggest band of all time according to a points system that measured sales of their biggest album, the scale of their biggest headlining show and the total number of weeks spent on the UK album chart  Rolling Stone ranked them number 51 on their list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  VH1 ranked them number 18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  Colin Larkin ranked Pink Floyd number 3 in his list of the 'Top 50 Artists of All Time', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist's albums included in his All Time Top 1000 Albums . In 2008, the head rock and pop critic of The Guardian , Alexis Petridis , wrote that the band occupy a unique place in progressive rock, stating, Thirty years on, prog is still persona non grata Only Pink Floyd—never really a prog band, their penchant for long songs and 'concepts' notwithstanding—are permitted into the 100 best album lists   Pink Floyd have won several awards  In 1981 audio engineer James Guthrie won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Album for The Wall , and Roger Waters won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Original Song Written for a Film in 1983 for Another Brick in the Wall from The Wall film . In 1995, Pink Floyd won the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for  Marooned . In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music; Waters and Mason attended the ceremony and accepted the award  They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010   Pink Floyd have influenced numerous artists  David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and The Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to  Dogs  from Animals . Other bands and artists who cite them as an influence include Queen , Radiohead , Steven Wilson , Marillion , Queensrÿche , Nine Inch Nails , the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins . Pink Floyd were an influence on the neo-progressive rock subgenre which emerged in the 1980s  The English rock band Mostly Autumn fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd in their sound   Pink Floyd were admirers of the Monty Python comedy group, and helped finance their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail . In 2016, Pink Floyd became the second band (after the Beatles ) to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail . In May 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of Pink Floyd's first single, an audio-visual exhibition, Their Mortal Remains , opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London  The exhibition featured analysis of cover art, conceptual props from the stage shows, and photographs from Mason's personal archive  It was extended for two weeks beyond its planned closing date of 1 October   Books  Documentaries     Powderfinger were an Australian rock band formed in Brisbane in 1989  From 1992 until their break-up in 2010, the line-up consisted of vocalist Bernard Fanning , guitarists Darren Middleton and Ian Haug , bass guitarist John Collins and drummer Jon Coghill . The group's third studio album Internationalist peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart in September 1998  They followed with four more number-one studio albums in a row: Odyssey Number Five (September 2000), Vulture Street (July 2003), Dream Days at the Hotel Existence (June 2007) and Golden Rule (November 2009). Their Top Ten hit singles are  My Happiness  (2000),  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind  (2003) and  Lost and Running  (2007). Powderfinger earned a total of eighteen ARIA Awards , making them the second-most awarded band behind Silverchair . Ten Powderfinger albums and DVDs certified multiple- platinum , with Odyssey Number Five – their most successful album – achieving eightfold platinum certification for shipment of over 560,000 units   After the release of their first DVD, These Days: Live in Concert (September 2004), and the compilation album Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 (November 2004), the group announced a hiatus in 2005  The June 2007 announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with Silverchair, Across the Great Divide tour , followed the release of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . Powderfinger were also involved in various philanthropic causes  In 2005, they performed at a WaveAid concert in Sydney , to help raise funds for areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake . Another performance at the Sydney Opera House in October 2007 raised funds for breast cancer victims and their families  One aim of their Across the Great Divide Tour was to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia , and awareness of the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children  In April 2010 Powderfinger announced that they would be breaking up after their Sunsets Farewell Tour , declaring it would be their last ever as they had musically said everything they wanted to say  On 13 November 2010, they played their last concert, signifying their disbandment  In November the following year, rock music journalist Dino Scatena and Powderfinger published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band   On 23 May 2020, the band reformed for a one-off livestreamed charity performance, One Night Lonely .  Powderfinger were formed in 1989 by Steven Bishop (ex-the Eternal) on drums, John Collins (the Eternal) on bass guitar, and Ian Haug (the Vibrants, the Fossils) on guitar and vocals  The Eternal, the Vibrants, and the Fossils were other Brisbane-based outfits  All three members of Powderfinger were students at Brisbane Grammar School – a private school in Spring Hill – and they started as a cover band playing pub rock classics by the Rolling Stones , the Doors , Led Zeppelin , Steppenwolf , Rodriguez , and Neil Young . The band's name comes from Young's song of the same name . Despite their popularity in Brisbane, when playing a heavy metal gig in Newcastle, New South Wales , in 1990, Powderfinger were booed off stage   After completing secondary education, Collins and Haug attended the University of Queensland , where the latter met Bernard Fanning in an economics class – and learned that Fanning had similar interests in music and could sing  Fanning took over the role of lead vocals from Haug and also provided guitar and harmonica  Late in 1990, Jon Coghill – another university student with Fanning and Haug – replaced Bishop on drums, which was described as a mutual leaving  Bishop later worked in London-based bands based in London, UK , before returning to Brisbane where he was a member of Moonjuice and then the Haymakers  Powderfinger's final line-up change was in 1992 with the addition of Darren Middleton (The Pirates) on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals  Powderfinger initially performed cover versions of other artists' songs, but gradually developed by writing and performing their own material   In August 1992, the group self-funded a seven-track self-titled extended play , also known as the Blue EP , on their own Finger label, and the album was distributed by MDS  It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane  The EP has an early version of  Save Your Skin , co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton, and Fanning; it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a single from their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears . Their second EP, Transfusion , was issued in September 1993 and distributed by Polydor Records . At that time, Simon McKenzie of Time Off noted they were hoping the major label will put a bit of weight behind the disc, but it's not as though they've signed a record deal or anything  McKenzie felt the EP showed they were wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, but is it also a reaction against the sixties tags they've been stuck with . The five tracks include Reap What You Sow, which reached the No  1 spot on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart , replacing Nirvana 's  Heart-Shaped Box . The group recorded their first music video , for Reap What You Sow; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos  After the EP's success, the group were signed by Polydor   In January 1994, Powderfinger performed on the Big Day Out Tour (see 1994 line-up ). On 18 July that year, they released their debut studio album, Parables for Wooden Ears , under Polydor  According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane , it featured complex, meticulously crafted rock but was somewhat ponderous and sombre, which did little to fulfil the promise displayed on Transfusion . The album was produced by Tony Cohen ( Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds , The Cruel Sea ), and Fanning later described it as the band's dark dark days  It received limited radio coverage  Supporting the album's release, the band toured heavily, appearing at the Livid and Homebake music festivals  Powderfinger supported United States visitors Pantera on that group's Driven Downunder Tour '94  Another Australian support act on the tour was Newcastle-formed band Silverchair . Three singles were released from Powderfinger's debut album –  Tail ,  Grave Concern , and  Save Your Skin  – but none appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top 50  Following the album's release and lukewarm reception, in April 1995, the band recorded at Melbourne's Metropolis Studio with Lachlan Magoo Goold ( Regurgitator ) and in July released a five-track EP, Mr Kneebone .  The band's second studio album, Double Allergic , was issued on 2 September 1996; it peaked at No  4 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified triple  platinum by ARIA for shipment of 210,000 units by 2007  It was co-produced by Tim Whitten and the group  McFarlane felt this album was more self-assured and textured consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene, alongside the likes of You Am I , Spiderbait , Silverchair, Regurgitator and Tumbleweed  was full of accessible, spirited rock  Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll noted  revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves  Powderfinger's reason to be is to create songs strong enough for the band and audience to play and hear months or years down the line  Four singles were released from the album –  Pick You Up ,  D.A.F. ,  Living Type , and  Take Me In . Take Me In was released as a video single featuring several other music videos by the group  FasterLouder, a music review web site, recalled that when Double Allergic was released in 1996, it showed the band were here for the long haul to become arguably one of the best of the decade  In 1997 the album was issued in Canada and the group toured North America to promote it   On 7 September 1998, Powderfinger released their third studio album, Internationalist , which peaked at No  1 and spent 101 weeks in the Top 50 of the ARIA Albums Chart; it was produced by Nick DiDia ( Rage Against the Machine , Pearl Jam ). AllMusic 's Jonathan Lewis had mixed feelings about the album  He was enchanted by its lead single,  The Day You Come , however the rest of the album didn't measure up except for some fine tracks in Don't Wanna Be Left Out and Already Gone  Nevertheless, by 2007 the album had shipped over 350,000 copies and was certified five times platinum domestically, and had reached European audiences  Internationalist was the first Powderfinger album to win any ARIA Music Awards . At the 1999 ceremony it won Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Kevin Wilkins), and The Day You Come won Single of the Year   Passenger , another single from Internationalist , was nominated for three additional categories in the following year . The band was both praised and criticised for their political views on Internationalist . In a November 1998 interview with Benedict Watts of Juice Magazine , Haug said that political messages in The Day You Come were not something they were just preaching about, but rather were something they saw as a responsibility   Powderfinger's fourth studio album, Odyssey Number Five , was released on 4 September 2000, and also peaked at No  1. Entertainment Weekly ' s Marc Weingarten provided a positive review and found the group prove that there's still terrain left to be explored guitar rock ... melancholy is the default mode ... can be as prim as Travis or as mock-grandiose as Oasis . However, Allmusic's Dean Carlson was more negative, seeing the album as little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American grunge . Odyssey Number Five is Powderfinger's most commercially successful album, shipping 560,000 copies and certified eight times platinum by 2004  It also appeared on the New Zealand Albums Chart at No  15  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 , the group won Album of the Year, Highest Selling Album, Best Rock Album, Best Cover Art (by Wilkins), and Best Group   Two of Odyssey Number Five ' s tracks featured on film soundtracks:  These Days , written for Two Hands (1999), and  My Kind of Scene  in Mission: Impossible 2 (2000). Singles from the album are My Kind of Scene,  My Happiness ,  Like a Dog , and the double A-side  The Metre / Waiting for the Sun . My Happiness, which peaked at No  4 in Australia and No  7 in New Zealand, is the group's highest-charting single in both countries  At the ARIA Awards ceremony, My Happiness won Single of the Year, and other songs were nominated in various categories  Their tracks received votes from national radio station Triple J 's listeners on annual Hottest 100 lists: These Days, Already Gone,  Good-Day Ray , and Passenger were ranked in 1999 , and My Happiness and My Kind of Scene in 2000 . In 2009, These Days was voted at No  21 and My Happiness at No  27 in the Hottest 100 of all time, placing them as second- and fourth-highest Australian tracks after the Hilltop Hoods '  The Nosebleed Section  and Hunters &amp; Collectors '  Throw Your Arms Around Me , respectively   Powderfinger's Vulture Street was released on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No  1 in Australia, while in New Zealand it reached No  17  Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for the location of the band's first recording room in West End , Brisbane  The Sydney Morning Herald ' s music critic Bernard Zuel approved of a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album with a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect; he felt it had Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut album  Simon Evans of musicOMH described the group as having opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs  Middleton explained that the band's aim was to get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things we grew up loving, which was Bowie , Zeppelin , Kiss ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s  We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it's a very old-school-sounding record  It's all the old amps, we used old guitars and recorded to tape , of course  It's fairly organic in that sense  Vulture Street won four ARIA Awards in 2003 : Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design). Singles issued from the album are:  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind ,  Since You've Been Gone ,  Love Your Way , and  Sunsets . Tracks were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004 .  In September 2004 the group issued their first live album, These Days: Live in Concert , initially as a CD , and followed in October with a two-disc DVD . One single,  Stumblin' , which had appeared on Vulture Street , was issued as a live version  In late October they released a compilation album, Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 , which included many of their singles from the first four albums as well as non-singles Thrilloilogy and Belter, and a re-release of These Days  These Days, although never officially released as a single, was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll of 1999  The album also included two new songs:  Bless My Soul  and Process This, although only Bless My Soul was released as a single  Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger appeared at the WaveAid fundraising concert in January 2005 in Sydney, to raise funds for aid organisations working in the disaster-affected areas  Fanning, as a member of The Wrights , sang lead vocals on  Evie, part 2  at the concert  The Wrights released a studio version in March as a single with some of the proceeds going to tsunami relief efforts   After the WaveAid concert, from early 2005, Powderfinger had a period of hiatus  During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the personal front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife  Middleton's side project, Drag , had issued an EP, Gas Food Lodging , in 2002  Zombos Reviews found the EP was full of well-written jangly pop, and has some rather nice ballads  Their debut album, The Way Out , recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July, was a tad disappointing ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads  Everything's tastefully arranged, and there's always nice melodies and harmonies  Collins and Haug formed The Predators with Powderfinger's former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals  The group released a six-track EP, Pick Up the Pace , in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia   In October 2005 Fanning issued his debut solo album, Tea &amp; Sympathy , which reached No  1 in Australia and No  11 in New Zealand  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 , Fanning won in four categories including Album of the Year for Tea &amp; Sympathy and Best Video for its lead single,  Wish You Well . Wish You Well was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll in 2005  At the end of 2006, Fanning toured in support of the album's release in the United Kingdom and North America; at its conclusion, Powderfinger resumed from their hiatus  Fanning compared his solo work to Powderfinger recordings, saying, when a problem came up in the studio, especially guitar-wise, I've always had Darren and Ian to call on  They could usually come up with something good  But I played all the guitar on it, and my abilities are fairly limited and that Powderfinger is my real job and I'm looking forward to doing it again   Powderfinger started recording their sixth studio album, Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , in January 2007; it was released on 2 June  Debuting at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart – their fourth to do so consecutively – it broke the Australian digital sales record with over 3,000 copies sold online  In general, reviewers did not rate it as highly as its predecessor Vulture Street , with Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun HiT describing it as No radical reinvention, no huge change in direction ... In a word: consistent  Zuel described it as Powderfinger's first dull album but the band as the biggest rock band in the country   Lost and Running , their first single for three years, had been issued in May, and reached No  5. A second single,  I Don't Remember , appeared in August  One song from the album,  Black Tears , was amended following concerns that it could prejudice a trial over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  Fanning stated that an alternative version would be on the album as a result of the concerns  On 18 August that year, Powderfinger performed a concert in Karratha as part of Triple J's AWOL Series  The band was supported by The Grates and Muph N Plutonic, and various local acts  While in Karratha, Fanning and Coghill visited Gumala Mirnuwarni, a local school in Roebourne that encourages children to stay in school   In June 2007 Powderfinger and Silverchair announced the nine-week Across the Great Divide tour to promote reconciliation with Indigenous Australians . From August to October that year the two groups toured all state capital cities as well as fourteen Australian regional centres, and included four performances in New Zealand  They performed 34 concerts in 26 towns across Australia, with an estimated total of 220,000 people in attendance  On 1 December, a triple-DVD set was released with the same title as the tour , with the Melbourne performances for both bands and backstage footage from the tour  The schedule consisted of three main parts, beginning with a supporting artist performing one set, followed by Silverchair and then Powderfinger playing the final set  The two bands united on stage during only three performances throughout the tour, including Daniel Johns (Silverchair) and Fanning sharing lead vocals on a cover version of The Who 's  Substitute  at one show in Sydney and two in Melbourne   Dream Days at the Hotel Existence was the recipient of the ARIA Award for Best Cover Art in 2007 . It was also nominated for Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Group, while Lost and Running received nominations for Single of the Year and Best Video  Powderfinger failed to win any of these awards, with tour mates Silverchair's Young Modern and  Straight Lines  obtaining all five  On 28 October at the ceremony, Powderfinger performed Lost and Running  The third single from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence ,  Nobody Sees , was released in December 2007  On 27 September 2008, Powderfinger performed (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind and AC/DC 's  Long Way to the Top  at the AFL Grand Final . Their song Drifting Further Away featured on Grey's Anatomy ' s fifth season in episode 13,  Stairway to Heaven , which aired on 21 January 2009   From mid-June 2009 Powderfinger worked with DiDia producing their seventh studio album, Golden Rule , which was issued on 13 November  The album peaked at No  1 on the ARIA albums chart – becoming their fifth studio album in a row to do so  The album's lead single,  All of the Dreamers , was released in September  Burn Your Name, the second single, followed in December  That same month the band performed at the 2009 Homebake festival after a 10-year absence  In late January they toured on the 2010 Big Day Out  The third single from the album, Sail the Widest Stretch, appeared in April   Also in April 2010, Powderfinger announced that after 21 years the group would disband following their Sunsets Farewell Tour in September and October that year:  With the completion of our last album, Golden Rule , we feel that we have said all that we want to say as a musical group  We firmly believe that it is our most complete and satisfying album and can't think of a better way to farewell our fans than with music that we all believe in and also with, hopefully, our best tour to date   Coghill told Australian Times that the final tour is going to be great fun, but it's also going to be sad  He confirmed that he had no plans to start a new band or for a solo project  Instead he intended to finish his degree,  nce I'm done with that, I might put the feelers out and see what's happening  I don't think I'd be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just to have a chance to keep playing  I'm just not keen to be off touring the world anymore  Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was These Days  On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, I'm on Your Side, as a fundraiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of major flooding in Queensland from December the previous year into January  The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause  On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, Footprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 2001–2011 , containing two new tracks  There was also a 2-disc release, Fingerprints &amp; Footprints – The Ultimate Collection , combining both Fingerprints and Footprints in one set  Also in November, Dino Scatena, together with the band, published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band . Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in October of the previous year, during the Sunsets Farewell Tour   Former Powderfinger member Bernard Fanning worked on his second solo album Departures during late 2012 in Los Angeles, with Joe Chiccarelli producing  It was released in June the following year and peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart  Middleton had relocated to Melbourne and worked with Red Door Sounds' Paul Annison – producer of Children Collide 's album Monument (April 2012). In December that year Middleton revealed that I’m halfway through a new record  Middleton's album, Translations , was released independently in November 2013  Around the same time Coghill was working as a journalist on the Gold Coast, while Collins was developing business projects in Queensland   In January 2013 Haug produced the second album, Sins of a Li'l Later Kiss , by Brisbane-based folk duo Cole and Van Dijk  He then joined the Church , replacing Marty Willson-Piper , and featured on their 2014 album Further/Deeper .  On the 23 May 2020, Powderfinger reformed for a one off, live-streamed YouTube charity performance titled, One Night Lonely with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue and Support Act  On 25 May, an EP of the performance was released   On 31 August 2020, Powderfinger confirmed the release of a compilation album of unreleased songs titled Unreleased (1998–2010) due on the 27th November 2020, which was preceded by the single Day by Day, released on 18 September   On 13 November 2020, Powderfinger released the second single preceding the release of the album Unreleased (1998-2010) Daybreak   Powderfinger's musical style includes hard rock and alternative music and, according to McFarlane, the band made its mark with an earthy, blues-based sound that combined soaring, 1970s-influenced riff-rock with 1990s studio technology  With the added textures of folk, country and a soulful groove, the band was able to head in any direction  Nimmervoll acclaimed them as one of Australia's most popular radio-friendly rock bands which produced music the rest of Australia embraced  McFarlane was partially disappointed with their debut 1994 album Parables for Wooden Ears compared to their earlier EP Transfusion . Their 1996 album, Double Allergic , was more self-assured and textured and consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene  It revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves according to Nimmervoll   In a November 2007 interview with Paul Cashmere of the website Undercover, Middleton stated that a couple of songs they had initially written for Vulture Street were just too Odyssey Number Five based, and that the first track, Rockin' Rocks, was probably the start of where we were heading with the album  Cashmere stated that the album was the toughest heard Powderfinger sound  Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger's more recent albums, and described Vulture Street as a rawer, louder album in comparison to Odyssey Number Five ; it highlighted Fanning's talent as a lyricist and he stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut  Zuel also stated that there is a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, and described On My Mind as having  AC/DC meatiness, and Love Your Way as acoustic tumbling into weaving Zeppelin lines  In his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , Zuel described it as  high-gloss and muscular framework, and stated that that was what American radio considers serious rock   Compared with the relatively lean, agile sound they've perfected up to now, this is Powderfinger as the footballer who in the off-season spends his time in the gym and emerges buff and beefy  The problem is he has bulk but has traded in his nimbleness   Clayton Bolger of AllMusic stated in his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence that Powderfinger largely revisit the sound of their Internationalist album, leaving behind much of the glam and swagger of 2003's Vulture Street . He commented on Fanning's commanding and distinctive vocals, the twin-guitar attack of Middleton and Haug, Collins' innovative basslines, and the powerhouse drum work of Coghill  Nimmervoll described Golden Rule as Powderfinger back to its essence  They’d experimented with the sound, tried different things with the songwriting process and recorded in America with different producers  was recorded at home, the band reunited with American Nick DiDia, who had previously worked with the band during the classic era, producing Internationalist , Odyssey Number 5 and Vulture Street . They also wrote the songs as a team, with Bernard responsible for the bulk of the lyrics  The album was recorded in the same spirit, as close to the live sound as a studio album could be   Powderfinger were active in supporting causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances  In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children's Hospital on 24 November  They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts Custard and You Am I to also appear on the steps of the Sydney Opera House . The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled Farewell to the World , was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people  In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005  The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area  The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected   The song  Black Tears  from the album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence originally had the lyric An island watchhouse bed, a black man's lying dead, which sparked fears that it might prejudice the trial of the former Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  The band claimed that the song's lyrics primarily dealt with the climbing of Uluru by tourists despite requests from the Indigenous people of the area to respect their sacred sites and not climb  The original version of the song was retracted from the album, and replaced with an alternative version with the criticised material removed  The legal team for Hurley, who was charged with manslaughter over the death of Mulrunji in 2004, had referred the song to the Attorney-General of Queensland , Kerry Shine , in their attempt at altering the track  One of Hurley's lawyers, Glen Cranny, stated that the content and proposed timing of the song's release raises some serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley's trial  Powderfinger's band manager, Paul Piticco , stated that Fanning had confirmed that a line in the song was related to the case  However, he added that the lyric in question could refer to a watchhouse in The Bahamas or something   In June 2007, Powderfinger and Silverchair announced their combined Across the Great Divide Tour, which promoted Reconciliation Australia , a foundation helping to improve the welfare of the Indigenous people of Australia, and to show both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation  Reconciliation Australia increased the awareness of the 17-year difference in life expectancy between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous children of Australia  In October that year, during Breast Cancer Awareness Month , Powderfinger performed another concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House  This concert was for invitees only – breast cancer patients, survivors, and their families were eligible to attend  Powderfinger performed alongside Silverchair, Missy Higgins , and other artists to an audience of 700  The concert was filmed and later broadcast as a MAX Session on Foxtel channel MAX on 3 November   For the Sunsets Farewell Tour in September 2010, the band promoted another Indigenous cause, the Yalari organisation  The organisation provides Indigenous children with opportunities to get a proper education  In January 2011, following the Queensland flood disaster , reported that Powderfinger would not reform for a benefit concert, but the band instead donated a never-before released track, I'm on Your Side, to help raise money for the victims   Throughout their recording career, Powderfinger consisted of five members: Bernard Fanning as lead vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist, and harmonicist; John Collins as bass guitarist; Ian Haug, originally the lead vocalist until Fanning joined, played lead guitars; Darren Middleton on co-lead guitars, keyboards, backing vocals, and occasional lead vocals; Jon Coghill as drummer and percussionist  Their lineup remained stable from 1992 until their disbandment in November 2010  Steven Bishop had been the group's original drummer, but had left to focus on his studies  The band refers to one another by nicknames, including Collins as JC and Coghill as Cogsy   Powderfinger have collaborated with various artists throughout their career: Pianist Benmont Tench played on Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . For touring or session work, auxiliary musicians used include Alex Pertout on percussion, Duane Billings on percussion, and Lachlan Doley on keyboards  For their second album, Double Allergic , the group enlisted Tim Whitten as producer  The group approached American expatriate Nick DiDia as their producer for Internationalist , and recorded with him at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne  DiDia also produced the two albums which followed  In 2007 Rob Schnapf , producer for Beck , was asked to produce Dream Days at the Hotel Existence in Los Angeles  DiDia returned for Golden Rule . Powderfinger's first music video, for the song Reap What You Sow in 1993, was directed by David Barker, an award-winning director  Film companies who directed other videos for the group include Fifty Fifty Films and Head Pictures   Powderfinger was highly successful in the Australian recording industry, being a recipient of the industry's flagship awards, the ARIA Music Awards, 18 times from 47 nominations – the third-highest behind Silverchair's 21 wins from 49 nominations and John Farnham 's 20 wins from 56 nominations  Powderfinger's most successful year was 2001 , when they won six awards from eight nominations for Odyssey Number Five and its related singles  These Days and My Happiness were ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 lists in 1999 and 2000 respectively, and 21 other Powderfinger tracks have ranked on lists in other years   In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Powderfinger were announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for their role as Influential Artists   General  Specific     Joseph Maurice Ravel ( French:  ; 7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor  He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy , although both composers rejected the term  In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer   Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire ; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal  After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of modernism, baroque , neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz . He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development  He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known   A slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries  Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music  Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration  Some of his piano music, such as Gaspard de la nuit (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chloé (1912) require skilful balance in performance   Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public  From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision   Ravel was born in the Basque town of Ciboure , France, near Biarritz , 18 kilometres (11 mi) from the Spanish border  His father, Pierre-Joseph Ravel , was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in Versoix near the Franco-Swiss border  His mother, Marie, née Delouart, was Basque but had grown up in Madrid  In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status – Marie was illegitimate and barely literate – but the marriage was a happy one  Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early internal combustion engine and a notorious circus machine, the Whirlwind of Death, an automotive loop-the-loop that was a major attraction until a fatal accident at Barnum and Bailey's Circus in 1903   Both Ravel's parents were Roman Catholics ; Marie was also something of a free-thinker , a trait inherited by her elder son  He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born  The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born  (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession ) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music  Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him  The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods   Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general  In later life, Ravel recalled, Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music  My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age  There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father   When he was seven, Ravel started piano lessons with Henry Ghys, a friend of Emmanuel Chabrier ; five years later, in 1887, he began studying harmony , counterpoint and composition with Charles-René, a pupil of Léo Delibes . Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy  Charles-René found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort  Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by Schumann , variations on a theme by Grieg and a single movement of a piano sonata  They survive only in fragmentary form   In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist Ricardo Viñes , who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music  The two shared an appreciation of Wagner , Russian music, and the writings of Poe , Baudelaire and Mallarmé . At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov . This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy , as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan , also heard during the Exposition   Émile Decombes took over as Ravel's piano teacher in 1889; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance  Aged fourteen, he took part in a concert at the Salle Érard along with other pupils of Decombes, including Reynaldo Hahn and Alfred Cortot .  With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the Conservatoire de Paris . In November 1889, playing music by Chopin , he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eugène Anthiome  Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student  Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer  The musicologist Arbie Orenstein writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period of immense growth   ... from adolescence to maturity   In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot , for piano, and Émile Pessard , for harmony  He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from Bériot but, in the words of the musicologist Barbara L. Kelly , he was only teachable on his own terms  His later teacher Gabriel Fauré understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s  Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes  His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: Sérénade grotesque , for piano, and Ballade de la Reine morte d'aimer, a mélodie setting a poem by Roland de Marès (both 1893).  Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Viñes and Cortot were  It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer  From this point he concentrated on composition  His works from the period include the songs Un grand sommeil noir and D'Anne jouant de l'espinette to words by Paul Verlaine and Clément Marot , and the piano pieces Menuet antique and Habanera (for four hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the Rapsodie espagnole . At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie , who was earning a living as a café pianist  Ravel was one of the first musicians – Debussy was another – who recognised Satie's originality and talent  Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them of inestimable value   In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with Fauré, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with André Gedalge . Both these teachers, particularly Fauré, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer  As Ravel's course progressed, Fauré reported a distinct gain in maturity   ... engaging wealth of imagination  Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, Théodore Dubois , who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook  Consequently, according to a fellow student, Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi , he was a marked man, against whom all weapons were good  He wrote some substantial works while studying with Fauré, including the overture Shéhérazade and a violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900  As a former student he was allowed to attend Fauré's classes as a non-participating auditeur until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903   In 1899 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: Pavane pour une infante défunte ( Pavane for a dead princess). It was originally a solo piano work, commissioned by the Princesse de Polignac . In 1897 he conducted the first performance of the Shéhérazade overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics  One described the piece as a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School and called Ravel a mediocrely gifted debutant   ... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years, if he works hard  Another critic, Pierre Lalo , thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven . Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic   From the start of his career, Ravel appeared calmly indifferent to blame or praise  Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine  The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own, perfectionist and severely self-critical  At twenty years of age he was, in the words of the biographer Burnett James, self-possessed, a little aloof, intellectually biased, given to mild banter  He dressed like a dandy and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour  Orenstein comments that, short in stature, light in frame and bony in features, Ravel had the appearance of a well-dressed jockey, whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect  During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century, Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day; from his mid-thirties he was clean-shaven   Around 1900 Ravel and a number of innovative young artists, poets, critics and musicians joined together in an informal group; they came to be known as Les Apaches (The Hooligans), a name coined by Viñes to represent their status as artistic outcasts  They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War, and members stimulated one another with intellectual argument and performances of their works  The membership of the group was fluid, and at various times included Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla as well as their French friends   Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy  Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued for more than ten years  In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique . It divided musical opinion  Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece  The Apaches were loud in their support  The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them   Debussy was widely held to be an impressionist composer – a label he intensely disliked  Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre  Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not  Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship  Ravel wrote that Debussy's genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition  For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy   ... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of symbolism . During the first years of the new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece Jeux d'eau (1901), the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works  Nichols calls the quartet at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence   The two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons  Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other  Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom  Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people  The public tension led to personal estrangement  Ravel said, It's probably better for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons  Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift  In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer Emma Bardac . Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante Misia Edwards and the opera star Lucienne Bréval , contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband    During the first years of the new century Ravel made five attempts to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome , past winners of which included Berlioz , Gounod , Bizet , Massenet and Debussy  In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition  In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy , the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies  In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a furore . He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable  The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu , was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received  L'affaire Ravel became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire   Among those taking a close interest in the controversy was Alfred Edwards , owner and editor of Le Matin , for which Lalo wrote  Edwards was married to Ravel's friend Misia; the couple took Ravel on a seven-week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905, the first time he had travelled abroad   By the latter part of the 1900s Ravel had established a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra  He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed  There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters  The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestrated 1910), Une barque sur l'océan (1906, from the 1905 piano suite Miroirs ), the Habanera section of Rapsodie espagnole (1907–08), Ma mère l'Oye (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911, orchestrated 1912), Alborada del gracioso (from Miroirs , orchestrated 1918) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).  Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them  Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent  Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters  He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound  When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity  The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams , who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08  Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner   ... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto   Vaughan Williams's recollections throw some light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation  Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels, Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women  By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange . Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual  Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry ; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery   Ravel's first concert outside France was in 1909  As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Société des Concerts Français, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation   The Société Nationale de Musique , founded in 1871 to promote the music of rising French composers, had been dominated since the mid-1880s by a conservative faction led by Vincent d'Indy . Ravel, together with several other former pupils of Fauré, set up a new, modernist organisation, the Société Musicale Indépendente, with Fauré as its president  The new society's inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Fauré's song cycle La chanson d'Ève , Debussy's piano suite D'un cahier d'esquisses , Zoltán Kodály 's Six pièces pour piano and the original piano duet version of Ravel's Ma mère l'Oye . The performers included Fauré, Florent Schmitt , Ernest Bloch , Pierre Monteux and, in the Debussy work, Ravel  Kelly considers it a sign of Ravel's new influence that the society featured Satie's music in a concert in January 1911   The first of Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy L'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911  The work had been completed in 1907, but the manager of the Opéra-Comique, Albert Carré , repeatedly deferred its presentation  He was concerned that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the Opéra-Comique's audience  The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular   In 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered  The first, to the orchestrated and expanded version of Ma mère l'Oye , opened at the Théâtre des Arts in January  The reviews were excellent: the Mercure de France called the score absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature  The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the Queen's Hall , London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year  The Times praised the enchantment of the work   ... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing  New York audiences heard the work in the same year  Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was Adélaïde ou le langage des fleurs , danced to the score of Valses nobles et sentimentales , which opened at the Châtelet in April  Daphnis et Chloé opened at the same theatre in June  This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete   Daphnis et Chloé was commissioned in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes . Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine , and designer, Léon Bakst . Fokine had a reputation for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music  This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music  There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work  It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London  The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere   Ravel composed little during 1913  He collaborated with Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky 's unfinished opera Khovanshchina , and his own works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier . In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of The Rite of Spring . Stravinsky later said that Ravel was the only person who immediately understood the music  Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande .  When Germany invaded France in 1914 Ravel tried to join the French Air Force . He considered his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator, but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint  While waiting to be enlisted, Ravel composed Trois Chansons , his only work for a cappella choir, setting his own texts in the tradition of French 16th-century chansons  He dedicated the three songs to people who might help him to enlist  After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist, Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915, when he was forty  Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend's courage: at his age and with his name he could have had an easier place, or done nothing  Some of Ravel's duties put him in mortal danger, driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment  At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother's failing health  His own health also deteriorated; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems, underwent a bowel operation following amoebic dysentery in September 1916, and had frostbite in his feet the following winter   During the war, the Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française was formed by Saint-Saëns, Dubois, d'Indy and others, campaigning for a ban on the performance of contemporary German music  Ravel declined to join, telling the committee of the league in 1916, It would be dangerous for French composers to ignore systematically the productions of their foreign colleagues, and thus form themselves into a sort of national coterie: our musical art, which is so rich at the present time, would soon degenerate, becoming isolated in banal formulas  The league responded by banning Ravel's music from its concerts   Ravel's mother died in January 1917, and he fell into a horrible despair, compounding the distress he felt at the suffering endured by the people of his country during the war  He composed few works in the war years  The Piano Trio was almost complete when the conflict began, and the most substantial of his wartime works is Le tombeau de Couperin , composed between 1914 and 1917  The suite celebrates the tradition of François Couperin , the 18th-century French composer; each movement is dedicated to a friend of Ravel's who died in the war   After the war, those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina  As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, Ravel's emotional equilibrium, so hard won in the previous decade, had been seriously compromised  His output, never large, became smaller  Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era  Fauré wrote to him, I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly  It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor  Ravel was offered the Legion of Honour in 1920, and although he declined the decoration, he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie's protégés Les Six as an establishment figure  Satie had turned against him, and commented, Ravel refuses the Légion d'honneur, but all his music accepts it  Despite this attack, Ravel continued to admire Satie's early music, and always acknowledged the older man's influence on his own development  Ravel took a benign view of Les Six, promoting their music, and defending it against journalistic attacks  He regarded their reaction against his works as natural, and preferable to their copying his style  Through the Société Musicale Indépendente, he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries  The Société presented concerts of recent works by American composers including Aaron Copland , Virgil Thomson and George Antheil and by Vaughan Williams and his English colleagues Arnold Bax and Cyril Scott .  Orenstein and Zank both comment that, although Ravel's post-war output was small, averaging only one composition a year, it included some of his finest works  In 1920 he completed La valse , in response to a commission from Diaghilev  He had worked on it intermittently for some years, planning a concert piece, a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz, mingled with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, fatal whirling  It was rejected by Diaghilev, who said, It's a masterpiece, but it's not a ballet  It's the portrait of a ballet  Ravel heard Diaghilev's verdict without protest or argument, left, and had no further dealings with him  Nichols comments that Ravel had the satisfaction of seeing the ballet staged twice by other managements before Diaghilev died  A ballet danced to the orchestral version of Le tombeau de Couperin was given at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in November 1920, and the premiere of La valse followed in December  The following year Daphnis et Chloé and L'heure espagnole were successfully revived at the Paris Opéra   In the post-war era there was a reaction against the large-scale music of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss . Stravinsky, whose Rite of Spring was written for a huge orchestra, began to work on a much smaller scale  His 1923 ballet score Les noces is composed for voices and twenty-one instruments  Ravel did not like the work (his opinion caused a cooling in Stravinsky's friendship with him) but he was in sympathy with the fashion for dépouillement – the stripping away of pre-war extravagance to reveal the essentials  Many of his works from the 1920s are noticeably sparer in texture than earlier pieces  Other influences on him in this period were jazz and atonality . Jazz was popular in Parisian cafés, and French composers such as Darius Milhaud incorporated elements of it in their work  Ravel commented that he preferred jazz to grand opera , and its influence is heard in his later music  Arnold Schönberg 's abandonment of conventional tonality also had echoes in some of Ravel's music such as the Chansons madécasses (1926), which Ravel doubted he could have written without the example of Pierrot Lunaire . His other major works from the 1920s include the orchestral arrangement of Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition (1922), the opera L'enfant et les sortilèges to a libretto by Colette (1926), Tzigane (1924) and the Violin Sonata (1927).  Finding city life fatiguing, Ravel moved to the countryside  In May 1921 he took up residence at Le Belvédère, a small house on the fringe of Montfort-l'Amaury , 50 kilometres (31 mi) west of Paris, in the Yvelines département . Looked after by a devoted housekeeper, Mme Revelot, he lived there for the rest of his life  At Le Belvédère Ravel composed and gardened, when not performing in Paris or abroad  His touring schedule increased considerably in the 1920s, with concerts in Britain, Sweden, Denmark, the US, Canada, Spain, Austria and Italy   Arbie Orenstein  After two months of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting  His fee was a guaranteed minimum of $ 10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes  He appeared with most of the leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities  Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary  At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York, the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat  Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed, You know, this doesn't happen to me in Paris  Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel's international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe's house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon . Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity  He commented that the critics' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, when they called him the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion   The last composition Ravel completed in the 1920s, Boléro , became his most famous  He was commissioned to provide a score for Ida Rubinstein 's ballet company, and having been unable to secure the rights to orchestrate Albéniz 's Iberia , he decided on an experiment in a very special and limited direction   ... a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of orchestral tissue without music  Ravel continued that the work was one long, very gradual crescendo  There are no contrasts, and there is practically no invention except the plan and the manner of the execution  The themes are altogether impersonal  He was astonished, and not wholly pleased, that it became a mass success  When one elderly member of the audience at the Opéra shouted Rubbish  at the premiere, he remarked, That old lady got the message  The work was popularised by the conductor Arturo Toscanini , and has been recorded several hundred times  Ravel commented to Arthur Honegger , one of Les Six, I've written only one masterpiece – Boléro . Unfortunately there's no music in it   At the beginning of the 1930s Ravel was working on two piano concertos  He completed the Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand first  It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein , who had lost his right arm during the war  Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project: In a work of this kind, it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands  Ravel, not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand, demonstrated it with both hands  Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece, but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work  In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim, and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year  The critic Henry Prunières wrote, From the opening measures, we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us   The Piano Concerto in G major was completed a year later  After the premiere in January 1932 there was high praise for the soloist, Marguerite Long, and for Ravel's score, though not for his conducting  Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting; they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted   Igor Stravinsky  In October 1932 Ravel suffered a blow to the head in a taxi accident  The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition  As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia . Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score  Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée . The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription  Ravel composed no more after this  The exact nature of his illness is unknown  Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour , and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia , Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease . Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months  Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head   In 1937 Ravel began to suffer pain from his condition, and was examined by Clovis Vincent , a well-known Paris neurosurgeon  Vincent advised surgical treatment  He thought a tumour unlikely, and expected to find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing  Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view  After the operation there seemed to be an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma  He died on 28 December, at the age of 62   On 30 December 1937 Ravel was interred next to his parents in a granite tomb at Levallois-Perret cemetery , in north-west Paris  He was an atheist and there was no religious ceremony   Marcel Marnat 's catalogue of Ravel's complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned  Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries, it is nevertheless inflated by Ravel's frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra  The performable body of works numbers about sixty; slightly more than half are instrumental  Ravel's music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera and song cycles  He wrote no symphonies or church works   Ravel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy  Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert , Liszt and Chopin  He considered himself in many ways a classicist , often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary , to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies  The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata   Ravel to Vaughan Williams  Ravel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is an implied melodic outline in all vital music  His themes are frequently modal instead of using the familiar major or minor scales  As a result, there are few leading notes in his output  Chords of the ninth and eleventh and unresolved appoggiaturas , such as those in the Valses nobles et sentimentales , are characteristic of Ravel's harmonic language   Dance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the bolero and pavane, but also the minuet , forlane , rigaudon , waltz , czardas , habanera and passacaglia . National and regional consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to Hebraic , Greek , Hungarian and gypsy themes  He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired – Borodin , Chabrier, Fauré and Haydn , interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style  Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion, with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude   Ravel completed two operas, and worked on three others  The unrealised three were Olympia , La cloche engloutie and Jeanne d'Arc . Olympia was to be based on Hoffmann 's The Sandman ; he made sketches for it in 1898–99, but did not progress far  La cloche engloutie after Hauptmann 's The Sunken Bell occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912, Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works, except for a Symphonie horlogère which he incorporated into the opening of L'heure espagnole . The third unrealised project was an operatic version of Joseph Delteil 's 1925 novel about Joan of Arc . It was to be a large-scale, full-length work for the Paris Opéra, but Ravel's final illness prevented him from writing it   Ravel's first completed opera was L'heure espagnole (premiered in 1911), described as a comédie musicale  It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career  Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects  Edward Burlingame Hill found Ravel's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action, and commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage  Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity  The critic David Murray writes that the score glows with the famous Ravel tendresse .  The second opera, also in one act, is L'enfant et les sortilèges (1926), a fantaisie lyrique to a libretto by Colette  She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto  It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than L'heure espagnole , and the jazz elements and bitonality of much of the work upset many Parisian opera-goers  Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work  The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout   Although one-act operas are generally staged less often than full-length ones, Ravel's are produced regularly in France and abroad   A substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal  His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome  His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as a static, recitative-like vocal style, prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility  By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in Histoires naturelles . The same technique is highlighted in Trois poèmes de Mallarmé (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided  In the cycles Shéhérazade and Chansons madécasses , Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment   Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as Cinq mélodies populaires grecques , Deux mélodies hébraïques and Chants populaires . Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue , Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine  For three songs dating from 1914–15, he wrote his own texts   Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices  Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade , to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score   During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous  He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use  The critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote, In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a pp tam-tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another   For all Ravel's orchestral mastery, only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra: Rapsodie espagnole , La valse and the two concertos  All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in Daphnis et Chloé , or as a reworking of piano pieces, Alborada del gracioso and Une barque sur l'ocean , ( Miroirs ), Valses nobles et sentimentales, Ma mère l'Oye , Tzigane (originally for violin and piano) and Le tombeau de Couperin  In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms  Occasionally, as in the Alborada del gracioso , critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original   In some of his scores from the 1920s, including Daphnis et Chloé , Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six to eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility  His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points  In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures  The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of Mozart and Saint-Saëns, alongside use of jazz-like themes  The critics Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor comment that in the slow movement, one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented, the composer can truly be said to join hands with Mozart  The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, Boléro (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm   Ravel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann, Chabrier, Debussy and Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition . Orchestral versions of the last by Mikhail Tushmalov , Sir Henry Wood and Leo Funtek predated Ravel's 1922 version, and many more have been made since, but Ravel's remains the best known  Kelly remarks on its dazzling array of instrumental colour, and a contemporary reviewer commented on how, in dealing with another composer's music, Ravel had produced an orchestral sound wholly unlike his own   Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch from the striking simplicity of Ma mère l'Oye to the transcendental virtuosity of Gaspard de la nuit . Ravel's earliest major work for piano, Jeux d'eau (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later  When writing for solo piano, Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity  The authors of The Record Guide consider that works such as Gaspard de la Nuit and Miroirs have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself   Most of Ravel's piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges  Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing  It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in Alborada del gracioso   ... and the two outer movements of Gaspard de la nuit . Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale  This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in Gaspard de la nuit , Le gibet would bore the audience to death  Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing   Ravel's regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works; Menuet sur le nom de Haydn (1909), À la manière de Borodine (1912), À la manière de Chabrier (1913) and Le tombeau de Couperin all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically Ravellian manner  Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions: Listen to Le tombeau de Couperin and the complete ballet music for Ma mère L'Oye in the classic recordings conducted by André Cluytens , and the piano versions never sound quite the same again   Apart from a one-movement sonata for violin and piano dating from 1899, unpublished in the composer's lifetime, Ravel wrote seven chamber works  The earliest is the String Quartet (1902–03), dedicated to Fauré, and showing the influence of Debussy's quartet of ten years earlier  Like the Debussy, it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers, with more succinct melodies, fluently interchanged, in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour  The Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet (1905) was composed very quickly by Ravel's standards  It is an ethereal piece in the vein of the Pavane pour une infante défunte . Ravel also worked at unusual speed on the Piano Trio (1914) to complete it before joining the French Army  It contains Basque, Baroque and far Eastern influences, and shows Ravel's growing technical skill, dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello, blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own, in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson   Ravel's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920–22), the Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Fauré for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of Tzigane for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923–27). The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel's teacher, and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist Jelly d'Arányi . The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody  His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work  Ravel said that the violin and piano are essentially incompatible instruments, and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility  Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor consider the post-war sonatas rather laboured and unsatisfactory, and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel's pre-war chamber works   Ravel's interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on piano roll between 1914 and 1928, although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by Robert Casadesus , a better pianist  Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc  In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of Jeux d'eau played by Mark Hambourg , and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the Pavane pour une infante défunte and Ondine , and movements from the String Quartet, Le tombeau de Couperin and Ma mère l'Oye . Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public, and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works, some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor  A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as Conducted by the composer, although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton  Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a Boléro in 1930, and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist   Ravel declined not only the Légion d'honneur, but all state honours from France, refusing to let his name go forward for election to the Institut de France . He accepted foreign awards, including honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921, the Belgian Ordre de Léopold in 1926, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1928   After Ravel's death, his brother and legatee, Edouard, turned the composer's house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it  As of 2018 the maison-musée de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours   In his later years, Edouard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind  After his death in 1960, the estate passed through several hands  Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were  The British newspaper The Guardian reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair      Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns ( French:  ; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era . His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (Organ) Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886).  Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten  After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri , Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine , the official church of the French Empire . After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas   As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann , Liszt and Wagner , although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition  He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers  This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six , he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death   Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years  It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré , among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel . Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius   Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin  Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris , and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice , always considered himself a true Parisian  Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption (tuberculosis) on the first anniversary of his marriage  The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil , 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris   When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson  Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano  His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty , a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner . Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training  Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young  The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart  The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel , in a programme that included Mozart 's Piano Concerto in B ♭ ( K 450), and Beethoven 's Third Piano Concerto . Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher Alexandre Pierre François Boëly . From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of Bach , which was then little known in France   As a schoolboy Saint-Saëns was outstanding in many subjects  In addition to his musical prowess, he distinguished himself in the study of French literature, Latin and Greek, divinity, and mathematics  His interests included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life   In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire , France's foremost music academy  The director, Daniel Auber , had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative  Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist  His organ professor was François Benoist , whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam , César Franck , Charles Alkan , Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet . In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies  His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy , whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet   Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo . He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome , in 1852 but was unsuccessful  Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen , who made little mark during the rest of his career  In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile , for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize  The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).  On leaving the Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns accepted the post of organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville . The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year there were more than two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income  The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot , had been badly damaged in the aftermath of the French Revolution and imperfectly restored  The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered  With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E ♭ (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire . The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile   Among the musicians who were quick to spot Saint-Saëns's talent were the composers Gioachino Rossini , Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt , and the influential singer Pauline Viardot , who all encouraged him in his career  In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of La Madeleine , the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world   Although in later life he had a reputation for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner . Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions  He commented, I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character  They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me  But I am not, I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion   In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France  Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies  He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner  His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré , recalled in old age:  After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known  ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I had for him, throughout my life   Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager ). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals , with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school   In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome  Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer  He was once more unsuccessful  Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote:  We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy  We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing  I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity  But the other man, who is still a student, has that inner fire, inspiration, he feels, he can do things that can't be learnt and the rest he'll learn more or less  So I voted for him, sighing at the thought of the unhappiness that this failure must cause Saint-Saëns  But, whatever else, one must be honest   According to the musical scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his well-known bon mot about Saint-Saëns, He knows everything, but lacks inexperience (Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience). The winner, Victor Sieg , had a career no more notable than that of the 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency  The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation  He himself wrote, Art is intended to create beauty and character  Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it  In fact, it is very much better off when it does  The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul  The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius, and Bad music well written   While teaching at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of his energy into composing and performing, but after he left in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with vigour  In 1867 his cantata Les noces de Prométhée beat more than a hundred other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi . In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his Second Piano Concerto . Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s   In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine , professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music  Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out  Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war  During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871  With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals  Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society  The Société Nationale de Musique , with its motto, Ars Gallica , had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc , Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members   As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems , Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first poème symphonique was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872  In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged  La princesse jaune (The Yellow Princess), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique , Paris in June  It ran for five performances   Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother  In 1875, he surprised many by marrying  The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils  The marriage was not a success  In the words of the biographer Sabina Teller Ratner, Saint-Saëns's mother disapproved, and her son was difficult to live with  Saint-Saëns and his wife moved to the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince , in the Latin Quarter ; his mother moved with them  The couple had two sons, both of whom died in infancy  In 1878, the elder, André, aged two, fell from a window of the flat and was killed; the younger, Jean-François, died of pneumonia six weeks later, aged six months  Saint-Saëns and Marie-Laure continued to live together for three years, but he blamed her for André's accident; the double blow of their loss effectively destroyed the marriage   For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music  Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere  In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged  His four-act drame lyricque, Le timbre d'argent (The Silver Bell), to Jules Barbier 's and Michel Carré 's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production  The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances   The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition  Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died  He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities  After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all  He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted   In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila , his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire  Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation  Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892   Saint-Saëns was a keen traveller  From the 1870s until the end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries  His professional engagements took him most often to Germany and England; for holidays, and to avoid Parisian winters which affected his weak chest, he favoured Algiers and various places in Egypt   Saint-Saëns was elected to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878  In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday  On 28 July he disappeared from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say that he would not be returning  They never saw each other again  Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five  Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman  Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women  After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle  Marie told him, For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here   In the 1880s Saint-Saëns continued to seek success in the opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it was unthinkable that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera  He had two operas staged during the decade, the first being Henry VIII (1883) commissioned by the Paris Opéra  Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Saëns, normally a fluent, even facile composer, worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England  The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer's lifetime  When it was produced at Covent Garden in 1898, The Era commented that though French librettists generally make a pretty hash of British history, this piece was not altogether contemptible as an opera story   The open-mindedness of the Société Nationale had hardened by the mid-1880s into a dogmatic adherence to Wagnerian methods favoured by Franck's pupils, led by Vincent d'Indy . They had begun to dominate the organisation and sought to abandon its Ars Gallica ethos of commitment to French works  Bussine and Saint-Saëns found this unacceptable, and resigned in 1886  Having long pressed the merits of Wagner on a sometimes sceptical French public, Saint-Saëns was now becoming worried that the German's music was having an excessive impact on young French composers  His increasing caution towards Wagner developed in later years into stronger hostility, directed as much at Wagner's political nationalism as at his music   By the 1880s Saint-Saëns was an established favourite with audiences in England, where he was widely regarded as the greatest living French composer  In 1886 the Philharmonic Society of London commissioned what became one of his most popular and respected works, the Third (Organ) Symphony . It was premiered in London at a concert in which Saint-Saëns appeared as conductor of the symphony and as soloist in Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto , conducted by Sir Arthur Sullivan . The success of the symphony in London was considerable, but was surpassed by the ecstatic welcome the work received at its Paris premiere early the following year  Later in 1887 Saint-Saëns's drame lyrique Proserpine opened at the Opéra-Comique  It was well received and seemed to be heading for a substantial run when the theatre burnt down within weeks of the premiere and the production was lost   In December 1888 Saint-Saëns's mother died  He felt her loss deeply, and was plunged into depression and insomnia, even contemplating suicide  He left Paris and stayed in Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose   During the 1890s Saint-Saëns spent much time on holiday, travelling overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before  A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell through in 1893  He wrote one opera, the comedy Phryné (1893), and together with Paul Dukas helped to complete Frédégonde (1895) an opera left unfinished by Ernest Guiraud , who died in 1892  Phryné was well received, and prompted calls for more comic operas at the Opéra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring grand opera . His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement fantasia Africa (1891) and his Fifth (Egyptian) Piano Concerto , which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his début at the Salle Pleyel in 1846  Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother's tutelage and his public's long support   Among the concerts that Saint-Saëns undertook during the decade was one at Cambridge in June 1893, when he, Bruch and Tchaikovsky performed at an event presented by Charles Villiers Stanford for the Cambridge University Musical Society , marking the award of honorary degrees to all three visitors  Saint-Saëns greatly enjoyed the visit, and even spoke approvingly of the college chapel services: The demands of English religion are not excessive  The services are very short, and consist chiefly of listening to good music extremely well sung, for the English are excellent choristers  His mutual regard for British choirs continued for the rest of his life, and one of his last large-scale works, the oratorio The Promised Land , was composed for the Three Choirs Festival of 1913   In 1900, after ten years without a permanent home in Paris, Saint-Saëns took a flat in the rue de Courcelles, not far from his old residence in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré  This remained his home for the rest of his life  He continued to travel abroad frequently, but increasingly often to give concerts rather than as a tourist  He revisited London, where he was always a welcome visitor, went to Berlin, where until the First World War, he was greeted with honour, and travelled in Italy, Spain, Monaco and provincial France  In 1906 and 1909 he made highly successful tours of the United States, as a pianist and conductor  In New York on his second visit he premiered his Praise ye the Lord for double choir, orchestra and organ, which he composed for the occasion   Despite his growing reputation as a musical reactionary, Saint-Saëns was, according to Gallois, probably the only French musician who travelled to Munich to hear the premiere of Mahler 's Eighth Symphony in 1910  Nonetheless, by the 20th century Saint-Saëns had lost much of his enthusiasm for modernism in music  Though he strove to conceal it from Fauré, he did not understand or like the latter's opera Pénélope (1913), of which he was the dedicatee  In 1917 Francis Poulenc , at the beginning of his career as a composer, was dismissive when Ravel praised Saint-Saëns as a genius  By this time, various strands of new music were emerging with which Saint-Saëns had little in common  His classical instincts for form put him at odds with what seemed to him the shapelessness and structure of the musical impressionists, led by Debussy  Nor did the theories of Arnold Schönberg 's dodecaphony commend themselves to Saint-Saëns:  There is no longer any question of adding to the old rules new principles which are the natural expression of time and experience, but simply of casting aside all rules and every restraint  Everyone ought to make his own rules  Music is free and unlimited in its liberty of expression  There are no perfect chords, dissonant chords or false chords  All aggregations of notes are legitimate  That is called, and they believe it, the development of taste .  Holding such conservative views, Saint-Saëns was out of sympathy – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty  It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky 's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913  In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane   When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music during the First World War, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with their old teacher  They were privately concerned that their friend was in danger of looking foolish with his excess of patriotism, and his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy's En blanc et noir (1915): We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the cubist pictures  His determination to block Debussy's candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer's supporters  Saint-Saëns's response to the neoclassicism of Les Six was equally uncompromising: of Darius Milhaud 's polytonal symphonic suite Protée (1919) he commented, fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France   Saint-Saëns gave what he intended to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance as a result of the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities  These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German warships   In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut for a large invited audience; it was remarked that his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his personal bearing was admirable for a man of eighty-six  He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do  While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921  His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the cimetière du Montparnasse . Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881   In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Saëns in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians wrote:  Saint-Saëns is a consummate master of composition, and no one possesses a more profound knowledge than he does of the secrets and resources of the art; but the creative faculty does not keep pace with the technical skill of the workman  His incomparable talent for orchestration enables him to give relief to ideas which would otherwise be crude and mediocre in themselves ... his works are on the one hand not frivolous enough to become popular in the widest sense, nor on the other do they take hold of the public by that sincerity and warmth of feeling which is so convincing   Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saëns was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past  In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic D   C   Parker wrote, That Saint-Saëns knows Rameau   ... Bach and Handel , Haydn and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings  His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art   Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Saëns often favoured self-contained melodies  Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, supple and pliable, more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the phrase pattern AABB is characteristic  An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him  Grove observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring  In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar  Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although Grove points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works   The authors of the 1955 The Record Guide , Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor write that Saint-Saëns's brilliant musicianship was instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the fact that there are other forms of music besides opera  In the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary , Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Saëns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c.1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia  Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable  The Urbs Roma Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and thick and heavy in its effect  Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of fugal writing  The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ  It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune  The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Saëns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885). The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring motif treated in a Lisztian style of thematic transformation .  Saint-Saëns's four symphonic poems follow the model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the vulgar blatancy to which the earlier composer was prone  The most popular of the four is Danse macabre (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight  Saint-Saëns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation, but in this piece he featured the xylophone prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers  Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871) was composed soon after the horrors of the Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies  Rees rates Phaëton (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer's professed indifference to melody, and inspired in its depiction of the mythical hero and his fate  A critic at the time of the premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece  The last of the four symphonic poems, La jeunesse d'Hercule (Hercules's Youth, 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful  In the judgment of the critic Roger Nichols these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel   Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, Javot (1896), the score for the film L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), and incidental music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916  Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier .  Saint-Saëns was the first major French composer to write piano concertos  His First , in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the Second , in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works  The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary sonata form first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn cadenza . The scherzo second movement and presto finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist Zygmunt Stojowski commented that the work begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach  The Third Piano Concerto , in E ♭ (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines  The Fourth , in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second  It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos  According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns the Beethoven of France (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor  The work is known as the Egyptian concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in Luxor , and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing   The First Cello Concerto , in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section  It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by Pablo Casals and later players  The Second , in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections  It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saint-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult  There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's Second , in C major  The First, in A, was also completed in 1858  It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour  The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime  The Third , in B minor, written for Pablo de Sarasate , is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity  It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso , in A minor, Op  28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863  It changes from a wistful and tense opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, After a multi-stopped cadenza ... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major   Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde , Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques . During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work  The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior  In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics  Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune , which Harding describes as like Sullivan with a light French touch   Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s  In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content   ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable  Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models  From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs , which, like Massenet, he used sparingly  Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less variety of tempo within individual numbers  In a survey of recorded opera Alan Blyth writes that Saint-Saëns certainly learned much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of Aida , and Wagner, but from these excellent models he forged his own style   From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies , writing more than 140  He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder . Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (Persian Songs, 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (The Red Ash Tree, 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo ; others included Alphonse de Lamartine , Pierre Corneille , Amable Tastu , and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet  He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable  Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including Le lever du soleil sur le Nil (Sunrise over the Nile, 1898) and Hymne à la paix (Hymn to Peace, 1919), are for voice and orchestra  His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy .  Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios  Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein . He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence , of oratorio  He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra  In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre  In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Saëns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it   Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark  Nichols excepts the Étude en forme de valse (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique  Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed the French Beethoven, and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E ♭ (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas  He is not known even to have contemplated writing one  There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns's works for the piano are single short pieces  In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as Souvenir d'Italie (1887), Les cloches du soir (Evening bells, 1889) and Souvenir d'Ismaïlia (1895).  Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo  Some of them were written for use in church services – Offertoire (1853), Bénédiction nuptiale (1859), Communion (1859) and others  After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former   Saint-Saëns wrote more than forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years  One of the first of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, confident piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other cantabile . The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms  At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of baroque composers including Rameau and Lully .  Sabina Teller Ratner, 2005  In Ratner's view, the most important of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment  The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by Grove's Dictionary as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions  The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards  The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier  It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment  Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance  The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo   The woodwind sonatas are among the composer's last works  Ratner writes of them, The spare, evocative, classical lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement  Gallois comments that the Oboe Sonata begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of tarantella . For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata is the most important of the three: he calls it a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism amounting to a summary of the rest  The work contrasts a doleful threnody  in the slow movement with the finale, which pirouettes in 4/4 time, in a style reminiscent of the 18th century  The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata a model of transparency, vitality and lightness, containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation   The composer's most famous work, The Carnival of the Animals (1887), although far from a typical chamber piece, is written for eleven players, and is considered by Grove's Dictionary to be part of Saint-Saëns's chamber output  Grove rates it as his most brilliant comic work, parodying Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Rossini, his own Danse macabre and several popular tunes  He forbade performances of it during his lifetime, concerned that its frivolity would damage his reputation as a serious composer   Saint-Saëns was a pioneer in recorded music  In June 1904 The Gramophone Company of London sent its producer Fred Gaisberg to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the mezzo-soprano Meyriane Héglon in arias from Ascanio and Samson et Dalila , and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra). Saint-Saëns made more recordings for the company in 1919   In the early days of the LP record , Saint-Saëns's works were patchily represented on disc  The Record Guide (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of Danse Macabre , The Carnival of the Animals , the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works  In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD  The 2008 Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Saëns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets  Also listed are an early Mass, collections of organ music, and choral songs  A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Saëns's mélodies was released in 1997   With the exception of Samson et Dalila the operas have been sparsely represented on disc  A recording of Henry VIII was issued on CD and DVD in 1992  Hélène was released on CD in 2008  There are several recordings of Samson et Dalilah , under conductors including Sir Colin Davis , Georges Prêtre , Daniel Barenboim and Myung-Whun Chung .  Saint-Saëns was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1867 and promoted to Officier in 1884, and Grand Croix in 1913  Foreign honours included the British Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1902, and honorary doctorates from the universities of Cambridge (1893) and Oxford (1907).  In its obituary notice, The Times commented:  The death of M. Saint-Saëns not only deprives France of one of her most distinguished composers; it removes from the world the last representative of the great movements in music which were typical of the 19th century  He had maintained so vigorous a vitality and kept in such close touch with present-day activities that, though it had become customary to speak of him as the doyen of French composers, it was easy to forget the place he actually took in musical chronology  He was only two years younger than Brahms, was five years older than Tchaikovsky, six years older than Dvořák , and seven years older than Sullivan  He held a position in his own country's music certain aspects of which may be fitly compared with each of those masters in their own spheres   In a short poem, Mea culpa, published in 1890 Saint-Saëns accused himself of lack of decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were not for him  An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day  The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form  The critic Henry Colles , wrote, a few days after the composer's death:  In his desire to maintain the perfect equilibrium we find the limitation of Saint-Saëns's appeal to the ordinary musical mind  Saint-Saëns rarely, if ever, takes any risks; he never, to use the slang of the moment, goes off the deep end  All his greatest contemporaries did  Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and even Franck, were ready to sacrifice everything for the end each wanted to reach, to drown in the attempt to get there if necessary  Saint-Saëns, in preserving his equilibrium, allows his hearers to preserve theirs   Grove concludes its article on Saint-Saëns with the observation that although his works are remarkably consistent, it cannot be said that he evolved a distinctive musical style  Rather, he defended the French tradition that threatened to be engulfed by Wagnerian influences and created the environment that nourished his successors   Since the composer's death writers sympathetic to his music have expressed regret that he is known by the musical public for only a handful of his scores such as The Carnival of the Animals , the Second Piano Concerto, the Third Violin Concerto, the Organ Symphony, Samson et Dalila , Danse macabre and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso  Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio , the ballet Javotte , the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces  In 2004, the cellist Steven Isserlis said, Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself ... there are Masses, all of which are interesting  I've played all his cello music and there isn't one bad piece  His works are rewarding in every way  And he's an endlessly fascinating figure      The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975  Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years, they are regarded as one of the most groundbreaking acts in the history of popular music . They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians  Their fashion and hairstyles have been credited as a significant influence on punk image , and they are often associated with anarchism within music   The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten , guitarist Steve Jones , drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock . Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977  Under the management of Malcolm McLaren , the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain  Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single  God Save the Queen , attacking Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they precipitated the punk rock movement  It was banned not only by the BBC but also by nearly every independent radio station, making it the most heavily censored record in British history   The band's only album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols (1977)—a UK number one album—is a staple record of punk rock  In January 1978, at the end of their over-hyped and turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten announced the band's break-up  Over the next few months, the three remaining band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex Pistols' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle . Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen . Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock briefly reunited for a concert tour in 1996   The Sex Pistols have been recognised as an influence on various genres, including grunge , indie , thrash metal and rap . In 2004, Rolling Stone placed them No  58 on its list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols—the four original members plus Vicious—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum a piss stain   The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar  According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments they had stolen  Early line-ups of The Strand—sometimes known as The Swankers—also included Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass  The band members regularly hung out at two clothing shops on the King's Road in Chelsea , London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor's Acme Attractions (where Don Letts worked as manager) and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood 's Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die  McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme  It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the 50's rocker look associated with Marlon Brando . As John Lydon later observed, Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto  The shop became a focal point of the punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious , Marco Pirroni , Gene October , and Mark Stewart , among many others  Jordan , the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look   In early 1974, Jones asked McLaren to manage The Strand  Effectively agreeing, McLaren paid for their first formal rehearsal space  Glen Matlock , an art student who occasionally worked at 'Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die', was recruited as the band's regular bassist  In November, McLaren temporarily relocated to New York City  Before his departure, McLaren and Westwood had conceived a new identity for their shop: renamed Sex , it changed its focus from retro couture to S&amp;M -inspired anti-fashion , with a billing as Specialists in rubberwear, glamourwear &amp; stagewear  After informally managing and promoting the New York Dolls for a few months, McLaren returned to London in May 1975  Inspired by the punk scene that was emerging in Lower Manhattan —in particular by the radical visual style and attitude of Richard Hell , then with Television —McLaren began taking a greater interest in The Strand members   The group had been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes , and had performed publicly for the first time  Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale was kicked out of the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties  According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones &amp; His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group  When those plans fell through, McLaren, Rhodes and the band began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties  As described by Matlock, Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so what we used to do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer  For instance, former singer with boy band Slik and future Ultravox front man Midge Ure claims to have been approached by McLaren, but to have refused the offer  With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation   In August 1975, Bernard Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old King's Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes  Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook  According to Jones, He came in with green hair  I thought he had a really interesting face  I liked his look  He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins  John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart  When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper 's  I'm Eighteen  on the shop jukebox  Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks  During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe  These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett  The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate  Waters commented: Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd   While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio  Thorgerson recalled that he sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there  He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him  Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience  Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth . Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US   In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space  In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals , in their newly finished 24-track studio  The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell 's political fable Animal Farm . The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep  Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station , over which they superimposed an image of a pig   The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis  Although Gilmour was largely responsible for Dogs, which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part  Pigs on the Wing . Wright commented: It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there  Mason recalled: Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately  Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album  Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals ; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering  Animals was the first Pink Floyd album with no writing credit for Wright, who said: This was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me   Released in January 1977, Animals peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three  NME described the album as one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music, and Melody Maker ' s Karl Dallas called it  uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific   Pink Floyd performed much of Animals during their  In the Flesh  tour  It was their first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band  Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance  On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to quit  At the Montreal Olympic Stadium , a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them  The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish   In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album  The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former  Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album  Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II . This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett  At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person   During the recording of The Wall , the band became dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution and fired him  Gilmour said that Wright was dismissed as he hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little  According to Mason, Wright would sit in on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'. Waters said the band agreed that Wright would either have to have a long battle or agree to leave quietly after the album was finished; Wright accepted the ultimatum and left   The Wall was supported by Pink Floyd's first single since Money,  Another Brick in the Wall (Part II) , which topped the charts in the US and the UK  The Wall was released on 30 November 1979 and topped the Billboard chart in the US for 15 weeks, reaching number three in the UK  It is number three on the RIAA 's list of the all-time Top 100 albums, with 23 million certified units sold in the US  The cover, with a stark brick wall and band name, was the first Pink Floyd album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis   Gerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the Wall tour  He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline, including the Mother, the Ex-wife and the Schoolmaster  Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances  Relationships within the band reached an all-time low; their four Winnebagos parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre  Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band  Wright returned as a paid musician, making him the only band member to profit from the tour, which lost about $600,000 (US$1,687,335 in 2019 dollars ).  The Wall was adapted into a film, Pink Floyd – The Wall . The film was conceived as a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved impractical to film  Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach  The animated sequences remained, but scenes were acted by actors with no dialogue  Waters was screentested, but quickly discarded and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the role of Pink  Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall ' s storyline as bollocks  Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed  Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd – The Wall premièred in the UK in July 1982   In 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks , originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall  With the onset of the Falklands War , Waters changed direction and began writing new material  He saw Margaret Thatcher 's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father  Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall . Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire  Michael Kamen , a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall , mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright  The tension within the band grew  Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure  After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions   Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album  With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure  Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself  Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US  Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album  Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused  Gilmour later commented: I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut . Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece  Loder viewed The Final Cut as essentially a Roger Waters solo album   Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face , in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters  He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd  Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity , which went almost unnoticed upon its release  Mason released his second solo album, Profiles , in August 1985   Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking , Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite  He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments  O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager  He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs  Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations  Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd  Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him  He went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd a spent force creatively   When Waters' lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name  Gilmour responded with a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist  The sides reached an out-of-court agreement, finalised on Gilmour's houseboat the Astoria on Christmas Eve 1987  In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members   In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason . There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions  Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence would make us stronger legally and musically, and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of $11,000   Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria , moored along the River Thames . The group found it difficult to work without Waters' creative direction; to write lyrics, Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough , eventually choosing Anthony Moore . Wright and Mason were out of practice; Gilmour said they had been destroyed by Roger, and their contributions were minimal   A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987  Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut , designed the album cover  To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle . The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US  Waters commented: I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate  Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: Roger's criticisms are fair  It's not a band album at all  Q magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album   Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name  Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral  Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice  Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them  As Pink Floyd toured North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances  Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig . Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design  The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall .  For several years Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event  In January 1993, they began working on a new album, The Division Bell , returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material  After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs  Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about 25 ideas   Contractually, Wright was not a member of the band, and said, It came close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album  However, he earned five co-writing credits, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here . Another songwriter credited on the album was Gilmour's future wife, Polly Samson . She helped him write several tracks, including  High Hopes , a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, pulled the whole album together, according to Ezrin  They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the album's orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned  Writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork  Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island ; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger  Eager to avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse , Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring  The Division Bell reached number 1 in the UK and the US, and spent 51 weeks on the UK chart   Pink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California , before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour  They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety  The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994  Mason published a memoir, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd , in 2004   On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24 years, at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park , London  The reunion was arranged by Live 8 organiser Bob Geldof ; after Gilmour declined the offer, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters  About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed  In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event   They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios  The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of the event  At the beginning of their performance of Wish You Were Here, Waters told the audience:  quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd  At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage  Waters called him back, and the band shared a group hug  Images of the hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity   Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136 million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only  However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen: The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in  It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that  It's just ... I've been there, I've done it  In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica , which declared: Patience for fans in mourning  The news is official  Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased  Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: It's over ... I've had enough  I'm 60 years old ... it is much more comfortable to work on my own  Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite   Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60  His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended  Wright said: The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death  Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire  Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to music  On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert Madcap's Last Laugh at the Barbican Centre in London  Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed the Barrett compositions  Bike  and Arnold Layne, and Waters performed a solo version of his song Flickering Flame   Wright died of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65  His former bandmates paid tributes to his life and work; Gilmour said: In the welter of arguments about who or what was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten  He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound  A week after Wright's death, Gilmour performed Remember a Day from A Saucerful of Secrets , written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute to him on BBC Two's Later .. with Jools Holland . Keyboardist Keith Emerson released a statement praising Wright as the backbone of Pink Floyd   On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation  The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, with an audience of approximately 200  In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour performed Comfortably Numb at Waters' performance of The Wall at the London O2 Arena on 12 May 2011, singing the choruses and playing the two guitar solos  Mason also joined, playing tambourine for  Outside the Wall  with Gilmour on mandolin   On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd ...   , reissuing the back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including Experience and Immersion multi-disc multi-format editions  The albums were remastered by James Guthrie , co-producer of The Wall . In November 2015, Pink Floyd released a limited edition EP, 1965: Their First Recordings , comprising six songs recorded prior to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn .  In 2012, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album  They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and generally harness studio technology  Waters was not involved  Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound  Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was   The Endless River was released on 7 November 2014, the second Pink Floyd album distributed by Parlophone following the release of the 20th anniversary editions of The Division Bell earlier in 2014  Though it received mixed reviews, it became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK and debuted at number one in several countries  The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997  Gilmour said The Endless River would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end  There was no supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was impossible without Wright  In 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were done and that to reunite without Wright would be wrong  Mason said in 2018 that Gilmour and Waters continued to be at loggerheads   In November 2016, Pink Floyd released a box set, The Early Years 1965–1972 , comprising outtakes, live recordings, remixes, and films from their early career  This was followed in December 2019 by The Later Years , compiling Pink Floyd's work after Waters' departure  The set includes a remixed version of A Momentary Lapse of Reason with more contributions by Wright and Mason, and an expanded reissue of the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder . In 2018, Mason formed a new band, Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets , to perform Pink Floyd's early material  The band includes Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet and longtime Pink Floyd collaborator Guy Pratt . They toured Europe in September 2018 and North America in 2019  Waters joined the band at the New York Beacon Theatre to perform vocals for  Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun .  Considered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, appearing at UFO Club and Middle Earth (club) . According to Rolling Stone : By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock , blues, country , folk , and electronic music . Released in 1968, the song Careful with That Axe, Eugene helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group  Other genres attributed to the band are space rock , experimental rock , acid rock , proto-prog , experimental pop (while under Barrett), psychedelic pop , and psychedelic rock . O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:  Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype  Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging ... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own ... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance   During the late 1960s, the press labelled their music psychedelic pop, progressive pop and progressive rock ; the band gained a following as a psychedelic pop group  In 1968, Wright commented on Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group  We never saw ourselves that way ... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun ... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted ... the emphasis ... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation  Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: There wasn't anything 'grand' about it  We were laughable  We were useless  We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental' ... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing  Interstellar Overdrive  for hours and hours  Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s   —Alan di Perna, in Guitar World , May 2006  Rolling Stone critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as integral to Pink Floyd's sound, and described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen . Rolling Stone named him the 14th greatest guitarist of all time  In 2006, Gilmour said of his technique:  fingers make a distinctive sound ... aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows . Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis .  In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures  According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on Money,  Time  and  Comfortably Numb  cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog  Brown described the Time solo as a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato  Brown described Gilmour's phrasing as intuitive and perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist  Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... singing sustain ... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold  It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade   Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound  Their second single, See Emily Play premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967  During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator . The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect  In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system   Waters experimented with the VCS 3 synthesiser on Pink Floyd pieces such as  On the Run ,  Welcome to the Machine , and  In the Flesh  . He used a binson echorec 2 delay effect on his bass-guitar track for  One of These Days .  Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut . Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect  The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones  The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears   Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee . In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder 's film More . The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets , the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter  While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni 's film Zabriskie Point , the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month  Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week  Eventually he used only three of their recordings  One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called The Violent Sequence, later became Us and Them, included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon . In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée , for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds . They composed the material in about a week at the Château d'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart   Regarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems  From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London  Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground   To celebrate the launch of the London Free School 's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of the Roundhouse , attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull . In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers , mirrors and stretched condoms . After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation  On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace , London  Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise  In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called  Moonhead .  In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows  In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named Algie  Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour  The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall . The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a 40 feet (12 m) high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience  They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story  They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story  One striking feature of the tour was the performance of Comfortably Numb  While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall  When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him  Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician  A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech   During the Division Bell Tour , an unknown person using the name Publius posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album  White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius  During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word enigma in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage  Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band   Marked by Waters' philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as purveyors of a distinctively dark vision  Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference  Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd  Author George Reisch described Meddle 's psychedelic opus, Echoes, as built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy , and collaboration with others  Despite having been labelled the gloomiest man in rock, author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist , dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics   Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's  Have a Cigar  deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives  The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes Pink is the name of one of the band members  According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce, a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience   Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd  Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War . Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours  Their film score, Obscured by Clouds , dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing  Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here : The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling  Waters commented: it's about none of us really being there ... should have been called Wish We Were Here .  O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music  Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall , with the lyrics to Comfortably Numb: I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye  I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone  Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, Jugband Blues: I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here   Author Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the powerful sounds and suggestive themes of Dark Side with The Wall 's portrayal of artistic alienation  He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm . Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: If you didn't care what happened to me  And I didn't care for you, then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each  The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia , the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines   The album's characters include the Dogs, representing fervent capitalists, the Pigs, symbolising political corruption, and the Sheep, who represent the exploited  Croskery described the Sheep as being in a state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity, a false consciousness . The Dog, in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation  Waters used Mary Whitehouse as an example of a Pig; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society  At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: You know that I care what happens to you  And I know that you care for me too  However, he also acknowledges that the Pigs are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a Dog who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them   —Waters, quoted in Harris, 2005  O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of Dark Side of the Moon 's  Brain Damage  with Karl Marx 's theory of self-alienation ; there's someone in my head, but it's not me  The lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's Welcome to the Machine suggest what Marx called the alienation of the thing ; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others  Allusions to the alienation of man's species being can be found in Animals ; the Dog reduced to living instinctively as a non-human  The Dogs become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a necessary and defensible position in a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle wrote Detmer  Alienation from others is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of The Wall .  War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of The Wall , and a recurring theme in the band's music  Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from Corporal Clegg (1968),  Free Four  (1972),  Us and Them  (1973),  When the Tigers Broke Free  and  The Fletcher Memorial Home  from The Final Cut (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled A Requiem for the Postwar Dream . The themes and composition of The Wall express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women   Waters' lyrics to The Dark Side of the Moon dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity  He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition  However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it an exhortation ... to embrace the positive and reject the negative  Reisch described The Wall as less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness  The Wall 's protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making  After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is crazy, over the rainbow  He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: have I been guilty all this time  Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him  He then stands trial for showing feelings of an almost human nature, further exacerbating his alienation of species being  As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault , Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies, contribute to his angst, according to Reisch   Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time  They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37 9 million albums sold in the US since 1993  The Sunday Times Rich List , Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million   In 2004, MSNBC ranked Pink Floyd number 8 on their list of The 10 Best Rock Bands Ever  In the same year, Q named Pink Floyd as the biggest band of all time according to a points system that measured sales of their biggest album, the scale of their biggest headlining show and the total number of weeks spent on the UK album chart  Rolling Stone ranked them number 51 on their list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  VH1 ranked them number 18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  Colin Larkin ranked Pink Floyd number 3 in his list of the 'Top 50 Artists of All Time', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist's albums included in his All Time Top 1000 Albums . In 2008, the head rock and pop critic of The Guardian , Alexis Petridis , wrote that the band occupy a unique place in progressive rock, stating, Thirty years on, prog is still persona non grata Only Pink Floyd—never really a prog band, their penchant for long songs and 'concepts' notwithstanding—are permitted into the 100 best album lists   Pink Floyd have won several awards  In 1981 audio engineer James Guthrie won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Album for The Wall , and Roger Waters won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Original Song Written for a Film in 1983 for Another Brick in the Wall from The Wall film . In 1995, Pink Floyd won the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for  Marooned . In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music; Waters and Mason attended the ceremony and accepted the award  They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010   Pink Floyd have influenced numerous artists  David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and The Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to  Dogs  from Animals . Other bands and artists who cite them as an influence include Queen , Radiohead , Steven Wilson , Marillion , Queensrÿche , Nine Inch Nails , the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins . Pink Floyd were an influence on the neo-progressive rock subgenre which emerged in the 1980s  The English rock band Mostly Autumn fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd in their sound   Pink Floyd were admirers of the Monty Python comedy group, and helped finance their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail . In 2016, Pink Floyd became the second band (after the Beatles ) to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail . In May 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of Pink Floyd's first single, an audio-visual exhibition, Their Mortal Remains , opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London  The exhibition featured analysis of cover art, conceptual props from the stage shows, and photographs from Mason's personal archive  It was extended for two weeks beyond its planned closing date of 1 October   Books  Documentaries     Powderfinger were an Australian rock band formed in Brisbane in 1989  From 1992 until their break-up in 2010, the line-up consisted of vocalist Bernard Fanning , guitarists Darren Middleton and Ian Haug , bass guitarist John Collins and drummer Jon Coghill . The group's third studio album Internationalist peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart in September 1998  They followed with four more number-one studio albums in a row: Odyssey Number Five (September 2000), Vulture Street (July 2003), Dream Days at the Hotel Existence (June 2007) and Golden Rule (November 2009). Their Top Ten hit singles are  My Happiness  (2000),  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind  (2003) and  Lost and Running  (2007). Powderfinger earned a total of eighteen ARIA Awards , making them the second-most awarded band behind Silverchair . Ten Powderfinger albums and DVDs certified multiple- platinum , with Odyssey Number Five – their most successful album – achieving eightfold platinum certification for shipment of over 560,000 units   After the release of their first DVD, These Days: Live in Concert (September 2004), and the compilation album Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 (November 2004), the group announced a hiatus in 2005  The June 2007 announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with Silverchair, Across the Great Divide tour , followed the release of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . Powderfinger were also involved in various philanthropic causes  In 2005, they performed at a WaveAid concert in Sydney , to help raise funds for areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake . Another performance at the Sydney Opera House in October 2007 raised funds for breast cancer victims and their families  One aim of their Across the Great Divide Tour was to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia , and awareness of the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children  In April 2010 Powderfinger announced that they would be breaking up after their Sunsets Farewell Tour , declaring it would be their last ever as they had musically said everything they wanted to say  On 13 November 2010, they played their last concert, signifying their disbandment  In November the following year, rock music journalist Dino Scatena and Powderfinger published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band   On 23 May 2020, the band reformed for a one-off livestreamed charity performance, One Night Lonely .  Powderfinger were formed in 1989 by Steven Bishop (ex-the Eternal) on drums, John Collins (the Eternal) on bass guitar, and Ian Haug (the Vibrants, the Fossils) on guitar and vocals  The Eternal, the Vibrants, and the Fossils were other Brisbane-based outfits  All three members of Powderfinger were students at Brisbane Grammar School – a private school in Spring Hill – and they started as a cover band playing pub rock classics by the Rolling Stones , the Doors , Led Zeppelin , Steppenwolf , Rodriguez , and Neil Young . The band's name comes from Young's song of the same name . Despite their popularity in Brisbane, when playing a heavy metal gig in Newcastle, New South Wales , in 1990, Powderfinger were booed off stage   After completing secondary education, Collins and Haug attended the University of Queensland , where the latter met Bernard Fanning in an economics class – and learned that Fanning had similar interests in music and could sing  Fanning took over the role of lead vocals from Haug and also provided guitar and harmonica  Late in 1990, Jon Coghill – another university student with Fanning and Haug – replaced Bishop on drums, which was described as a mutual leaving  Bishop later worked in London-based bands based in London, UK , before returning to Brisbane where he was a member of Moonjuice and then the Haymakers  Powderfinger's final line-up change was in 1992 with the addition of Darren Middleton (The Pirates) on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals  Powderfinger initially performed cover versions of other artists' songs, but gradually developed by writing and performing their own material   In August 1992, the group self-funded a seven-track self-titled extended play , also known as the Blue EP , on their own Finger label, and the album was distributed by MDS  It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane  The EP has an early version of  Save Your Skin , co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton, and Fanning; it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a single from their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears . Their second EP, Transfusion , was issued in September 1993 and distributed by Polydor Records . At that time, Simon McKenzie of Time Off noted they were hoping the major label will put a bit of weight behind the disc, but it's not as though they've signed a record deal or anything  McKenzie felt the EP showed they were wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, but is it also a reaction against the sixties tags they've been stuck with . The five tracks include Reap What You Sow, which reached the No  1 spot on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart , replacing Nirvana 's  Heart-Shaped Box . The group recorded their first music video , for Reap What You Sow; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos  After the EP's success, the group were signed by Polydor   In January 1994, Powderfinger performed on the Big Day Out Tour (see 1994 line-up ). On 18 July that year, they released their debut studio album, Parables for Wooden Ears , under Polydor  According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane , it featured complex, meticulously crafted rock but was somewhat ponderous and sombre, which did little to fulfil the promise displayed on Transfusion . The album was produced by Tony Cohen ( Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds , The Cruel Sea ), and Fanning later described it as the band's dark dark days  It received limited radio coverage  Supporting the album's release, the band toured heavily, appearing at the Livid and Homebake music festivals  Powderfinger supported United States visitors Pantera on that group's Driven Downunder Tour '94  Another Australian support act on the tour was Newcastle-formed band Silverchair . Three singles were released from Powderfinger's debut album –  Tail ,  Grave Concern , and  Save Your Skin  – but none appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top 50  Following the album's release and lukewarm reception, in April 1995, the band recorded at Melbourne's Metropolis Studio with Lachlan Magoo Goold ( Regurgitator ) and in July released a five-track EP, Mr Kneebone .  The band's second studio album, Double Allergic , was issued on 2 September 1996; it peaked at No  4 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified triple  platinum by ARIA for shipment of 210,000 units by 2007  It was co-produced by Tim Whitten and the group  McFarlane felt this album was more self-assured and textured consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene, alongside the likes of You Am I , Spiderbait , Silverchair, Regurgitator and Tumbleweed  was full of accessible, spirited rock  Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll noted  revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves  Powderfinger's reason to be is to create songs strong enough for the band and audience to play and hear months or years down the line  Four singles were released from the album –  Pick You Up ,  D.A.F. ,  Living Type , and  Take Me In . Take Me In was released as a video single featuring several other music videos by the group  FasterLouder, a music review web site, recalled that when Double Allergic was released in 1996, it showed the band were here for the long haul to become arguably one of the best of the decade  In 1997 the album was issued in Canada and the group toured North America to promote it   On 7 September 1998, Powderfinger released their third studio album, Internationalist , which peaked at No  1 and spent 101 weeks in the Top 50 of the ARIA Albums Chart; it was produced by Nick DiDia ( Rage Against the Machine , Pearl Jam ). AllMusic 's Jonathan Lewis had mixed feelings about the album  He was enchanted by its lead single,  The Day You Come , however the rest of the album didn't measure up except for some fine tracks in Don't Wanna Be Left Out and Already Gone  Nevertheless, by 2007 the album had shipped over 350,000 copies and was certified five times platinum domestically, and had reached European audiences  Internationalist was the first Powderfinger album to win any ARIA Music Awards . At the 1999 ceremony it won Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Kevin Wilkins), and The Day You Come won Single of the Year   Passenger , another single from Internationalist , was nominated for three additional categories in the following year . The band was both praised and criticised for their political views on Internationalist . In a November 1998 interview with Benedict Watts of Juice Magazine , Haug said that political messages in The Day You Come were not something they were just preaching about, but rather were something they saw as a responsibility   Powderfinger's fourth studio album, Odyssey Number Five , was released on 4 September 2000, and also peaked at No  1. Entertainment Weekly ' s Marc Weingarten provided a positive review and found the group prove that there's still terrain left to be explored guitar rock ... melancholy is the default mode ... can be as prim as Travis or as mock-grandiose as Oasis . However, Allmusic's Dean Carlson was more negative, seeing the album as little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American grunge . Odyssey Number Five is Powderfinger's most commercially successful album, shipping 560,000 copies and certified eight times platinum by 2004  It also appeared on the New Zealand Albums Chart at No  15  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 , the group won Album of the Year, Highest Selling Album, Best Rock Album, Best Cover Art (by Wilkins), and Best Group   Two of Odyssey Number Five ' s tracks featured on film soundtracks:  These Days , written for Two Hands (1999), and  My Kind of Scene  in Mission: Impossible 2 (2000). Singles from the album are My Kind of Scene,  My Happiness ,  Like a Dog , and the double A-side  The Metre / Waiting for the Sun . My Happiness, which peaked at No  4 in Australia and No  7 in New Zealand, is the group's highest-charting single in both countries  At the ARIA Awards ceremony, My Happiness won Single of the Year, and other songs were nominated in various categories  Their tracks received votes from national radio station Triple J 's listeners on annual Hottest 100 lists: These Days, Already Gone,  Good-Day Ray , and Passenger were ranked in 1999 , and My Happiness and My Kind of Scene in 2000 . In 2009, These Days was voted at No  21 and My Happiness at No  27 in the Hottest 100 of all time, placing them as second- and fourth-highest Australian tracks after the Hilltop Hoods '  The Nosebleed Section  and Hunters &amp; Collectors '  Throw Your Arms Around Me , respectively   Powderfinger's Vulture Street was released on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No  1 in Australia, while in New Zealand it reached No  17  Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for the location of the band's first recording room in West End , Brisbane  The Sydney Morning Herald ' s music critic Bernard Zuel approved of a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album with a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect; he felt it had Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut album  Simon Evans of musicOMH described the group as having opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs  Middleton explained that the band's aim was to get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things we grew up loving, which was Bowie , Zeppelin , Kiss ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s  We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it's a very old-school-sounding record  It's all the old amps, we used old guitars and recorded to tape , of course  It's fairly organic in that sense  Vulture Street won four ARIA Awards in 2003 : Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design). Singles issued from the album are:  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind ,  Since You've Been Gone ,  Love Your Way , and  Sunsets . Tracks were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004 .  In September 2004 the group issued their first live album, These Days: Live in Concert , initially as a CD , and followed in October with a two-disc DVD . One single,  Stumblin' , which had appeared on Vulture Street , was issued as a live version  In late October they released a compilation album, Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 , which included many of their singles from the first four albums as well as non-singles Thrilloilogy and Belter, and a re-release of These Days  These Days, although never officially released as a single, was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll of 1999  The album also included two new songs:  Bless My Soul  and Process This, although only Bless My Soul was released as a single  Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger appeared at the WaveAid fundraising concert in January 2005 in Sydney, to raise funds for aid organisations working in the disaster-affected areas  Fanning, as a member of The Wrights , sang lead vocals on  Evie, part 2  at the concert  The Wrights released a studio version in March as a single with some of the proceeds going to tsunami relief efforts   After the WaveAid concert, from early 2005, Powderfinger had a period of hiatus  During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the personal front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife  Middleton's side project, Drag , had issued an EP, Gas Food Lodging , in 2002  Zombos Reviews found the EP was full of well-written jangly pop, and has some rather nice ballads  Their debut album, The Way Out , recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July, was a tad disappointing ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads  Everything's tastefully arranged, and there's always nice melodies and harmonies  Collins and Haug formed The Predators with Powderfinger's former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals  The group released a six-track EP, Pick Up the Pace , in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia   In October 2005 Fanning issued his debut solo album, Tea &amp; Sympathy , which reached No  1 in Australia and No  11 in New Zealand  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 , Fanning won in four categories including Album of the Year for Tea &amp; Sympathy and Best Video for its lead single,  Wish You Well . Wish You Well was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll in 2005  At the end of 2006, Fanning toured in support of the album's release in the United Kingdom and North America; at its conclusion, Powderfinger resumed from their hiatus  Fanning compared his solo work to Powderfinger recordings, saying, when a problem came up in the studio, especially guitar-wise, I've always had Darren and Ian to call on  They could usually come up with something good  But I played all the guitar on it, and my abilities are fairly limited and that Powderfinger is my real job and I'm looking forward to doing it again   Powderfinger started recording their sixth studio album, Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , in January 2007; it was released on 2 June  Debuting at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart – their fourth to do so consecutively – it broke the Australian digital sales record with over 3,000 copies sold online  In general, reviewers did not rate it as highly as its predecessor Vulture Street , with Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun HiT describing it as No radical reinvention, no huge change in direction ... In a word: consistent  Zuel described it as Powderfinger's first dull album but the band as the biggest rock band in the country   Lost and Running , their first single for three years, had been issued in May, and reached No  5. A second single,  I Don't Remember , appeared in August  One song from the album,  Black Tears , was amended following concerns that it could prejudice a trial over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  Fanning stated that an alternative version would be on the album as a result of the concerns  On 18 August that year, Powderfinger performed a concert in Karratha as part of Triple J's AWOL Series  The band was supported by The Grates and Muph N Plutonic, and various local acts  While in Karratha, Fanning and Coghill visited Gumala Mirnuwarni, a local school in Roebourne that encourages children to stay in school   In June 2007 Powderfinger and Silverchair announced the nine-week Across the Great Divide tour to promote reconciliation with Indigenous Australians . From August to October that year the two groups toured all state capital cities as well as fourteen Australian regional centres, and included four performances in New Zealand  They performed 34 concerts in 26 towns across Australia, with an estimated total of 220,000 people in attendance  On 1 December, a triple-DVD set was released with the same title as the tour , with the Melbourne performances for both bands and backstage footage from the tour  The schedule consisted of three main parts, beginning with a supporting artist performing one set, followed by Silverchair and then Powderfinger playing the final set  The two bands united on stage during only three performances throughout the tour, including Daniel Johns (Silverchair) and Fanning sharing lead vocals on a cover version of The Who 's  Substitute  at one show in Sydney and two in Melbourne   Dream Days at the Hotel Existence was the recipient of the ARIA Award for Best Cover Art in 2007 . It was also nominated for Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Group, while Lost and Running received nominations for Single of the Year and Best Video  Powderfinger failed to win any of these awards, with tour mates Silverchair's Young Modern and  Straight Lines  obtaining all five  On 28 October at the ceremony, Powderfinger performed Lost and Running  The third single from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence ,  Nobody Sees , was released in December 2007  On 27 September 2008, Powderfinger performed (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind and AC/DC 's  Long Way to the Top  at the AFL Grand Final . Their song Drifting Further Away featured on Grey's Anatomy ' s fifth season in episode 13,  Stairway to Heaven , which aired on 21 January 2009   From mid-June 2009 Powderfinger worked with DiDia producing their seventh studio album, Golden Rule , which was issued on 13 November  The album peaked at No  1 on the ARIA albums chart – becoming their fifth studio album in a row to do so  The album's lead single,  All of the Dreamers , was released in September  Burn Your Name, the second single, followed in December  That same month the band performed at the 2009 Homebake festival after a 10-year absence  In late January they toured on the 2010 Big Day Out  The third single from the album, Sail the Widest Stretch, appeared in April   Also in April 2010, Powderfinger announced that after 21 years the group would disband following their Sunsets Farewell Tour in September and October that year:  With the completion of our last album, Golden Rule , we feel that we have said all that we want to say as a musical group  We firmly believe that it is our most complete and satisfying album and can't think of a better way to farewell our fans than with music that we all believe in and also with, hopefully, our best tour to date   Coghill told Australian Times that the final tour is going to be great fun, but it's also going to be sad  He confirmed that he had no plans to start a new band or for a solo project  Instead he intended to finish his degree,  nce I'm done with that, I might put the feelers out and see what's happening  I don't think I'd be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just to have a chance to keep playing  I'm just not keen to be off touring the world anymore  Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was These Days  On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, I'm on Your Side, as a fundraiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of major flooding in Queensland from December the previous year into January  The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause  On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, Footprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 2001–2011 , containing two new tracks  There was also a 2-disc release, Fingerprints &amp; Footprints – The Ultimate Collection , combining both Fingerprints and Footprints in one set  Also in November, Dino Scatena, together with the band, published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band . Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in October of the previous year, during the Sunsets Farewell Tour   Former Powderfinger member Bernard Fanning worked on his second solo album Departures during late 2012 in Los Angeles, with Joe Chiccarelli producing  It was released in June the following year and peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart  Middleton had relocated to Melbourne and worked with Red Door Sounds' Paul Annison – producer of Children Collide 's album Monument (April 2012). In December that year Middleton revealed that I’m halfway through a new record  Middleton's album, Translations , was released independently in November 2013  Around the same time Coghill was working as a journalist on the Gold Coast, while Collins was developing business projects in Queensland   In January 2013 Haug produced the second album, Sins of a Li'l Later Kiss , by Brisbane-based folk duo Cole and Van Dijk  He then joined the Church , replacing Marty Willson-Piper , and featured on their 2014 album Further/Deeper .  On the 23 May 2020, Powderfinger reformed for a one off, live-streamed YouTube charity performance titled, One Night Lonely with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue and Support Act  On 25 May, an EP of the performance was released   On 31 August 2020, Powderfinger confirmed the release of a compilation album of unreleased songs titled Unreleased (1998–2010) due on the 27th November 2020, which was preceded by the single Day by Day, released on 18 September   On 13 November 2020, Powderfinger released the second single preceding the release of the album Unreleased (1998-2010) Daybreak   Powderfinger's musical style includes hard rock and alternative music and, according to McFarlane, the band made its mark with an earthy, blues-based sound that combined soaring, 1970s-influenced riff-rock with 1990s studio technology  With the added textures of folk, country and a soulful groove, the band was able to head in any direction  Nimmervoll acclaimed them as one of Australia's most popular radio-friendly rock bands which produced music the rest of Australia embraced  McFarlane was partially disappointed with their debut 1994 album Parables for Wooden Ears compared to their earlier EP Transfusion . Their 1996 album, Double Allergic , was more self-assured and textured and consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene  It revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves according to Nimmervoll   In a November 2007 interview with Paul Cashmere of the website Undercover, Middleton stated that a couple of songs they had initially written for Vulture Street were just too Odyssey Number Five based, and that the first track, Rockin' Rocks, was probably the start of where we were heading with the album  Cashmere stated that the album was the toughest heard Powderfinger sound  Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger's more recent albums, and described Vulture Street as a rawer, louder album in comparison to Odyssey Number Five ; it highlighted Fanning's talent as a lyricist and he stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut  Zuel also stated that there is a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, and described On My Mind as having  AC/DC meatiness, and Love Your Way as acoustic tumbling into weaving Zeppelin lines  In his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , Zuel described it as  high-gloss and muscular framework, and stated that that was what American radio considers serious rock   Compared with the relatively lean, agile sound they've perfected up to now, this is Powderfinger as the footballer who in the off-season spends his time in the gym and emerges buff and beefy  The problem is he has bulk but has traded in his nimbleness   Clayton Bolger of AllMusic stated in his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence that Powderfinger largely revisit the sound of their Internationalist album, leaving behind much of the glam and swagger of 2003's Vulture Street . He commented on Fanning's commanding and distinctive vocals, the twin-guitar attack of Middleton and Haug, Collins' innovative basslines, and the powerhouse drum work of Coghill  Nimmervoll described Golden Rule as Powderfinger back to its essence  They’d experimented with the sound, tried different things with the songwriting process and recorded in America with different producers  was recorded at home, the band reunited with American Nick DiDia, who had previously worked with the band during the classic era, producing Internationalist , Odyssey Number 5 and Vulture Street . They also wrote the songs as a team, with Bernard responsible for the bulk of the lyrics  The album was recorded in the same spirit, as close to the live sound as a studio album could be   Powderfinger were active in supporting causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances  In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children's Hospital on 24 November  They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts Custard and You Am I to also appear on the steps of the Sydney Opera House . The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled Farewell to the World , was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people  In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005  The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area  The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected   The song  Black Tears  from the album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence originally had the lyric An island watchhouse bed, a black man's lying dead, which sparked fears that it might prejudice the trial of the former Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  The band claimed that the song's lyrics primarily dealt with the climbing of Uluru by tourists despite requests from the Indigenous people of the area to respect their sacred sites and not climb  The original version of the song was retracted from the album, and replaced with an alternative version with the criticised material removed  The legal team for Hurley, who was charged with manslaughter over the death of Mulrunji in 2004, had referred the song to the Attorney-General of Queensland , Kerry Shine , in their attempt at altering the track  One of Hurley's lawyers, Glen Cranny, stated that the content and proposed timing of the song's release raises some serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley's trial  Powderfinger's band manager, Paul Piticco , stated that Fanning had confirmed that a line in the song was related to the case  However, he added that the lyric in question could refer to a watchhouse in The Bahamas or something   In June 2007, Powderfinger and Silverchair announced their combined Across the Great Divide Tour, which promoted Reconciliation Australia , a foundation helping to improve the welfare of the Indigenous people of Australia, and to show both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation  Reconciliation Australia increased the awareness of the 17-year difference in life expectancy between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous children of Australia  In October that year, during Breast Cancer Awareness Month , Powderfinger performed another concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House  This concert was for invitees only – breast cancer patients, survivors, and their families were eligible to attend  Powderfinger performed alongside Silverchair, Missy Higgins , and other artists to an audience of 700  The concert was filmed and later broadcast as a MAX Session on Foxtel channel MAX on 3 November   For the Sunsets Farewell Tour in September 2010, the band promoted another Indigenous cause, the Yalari organisation  The organisation provides Indigenous children with opportunities to get a proper education  In January 2011, following the Queensland flood disaster , reported that Powderfinger would not reform for a benefit concert, but the band instead donated a never-before released track, I'm on Your Side, to help raise money for the victims   Throughout their recording career, Powderfinger consisted of five members: Bernard Fanning as lead vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist, and harmonicist; John Collins as bass guitarist; Ian Haug, originally the lead vocalist until Fanning joined, played lead guitars; Darren Middleton on co-lead guitars, keyboards, backing vocals, and occasional lead vocals; Jon Coghill as drummer and percussionist  Their lineup remained stable from 1992 until their disbandment in November 2010  Steven Bishop had been the group's original drummer, but had left to focus on his studies  The band refers to one another by nicknames, including Collins as JC and Coghill as Cogsy   Powderfinger have collaborated with various artists throughout their career: Pianist Benmont Tench played on Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . For touring or session work, auxiliary musicians used include Alex Pertout on percussion, Duane Billings on percussion, and Lachlan Doley on keyboards  For their second album, Double Allergic , the group enlisted Tim Whitten as producer  The group approached American expatriate Nick DiDia as their producer for Internationalist , and recorded with him at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne  DiDia also produced the two albums which followed  In 2007 Rob Schnapf , producer for Beck , was asked to produce Dream Days at the Hotel Existence in Los Angeles  DiDia returned for Golden Rule . Powderfinger's first music video, for the song Reap What You Sow in 1993, was directed by David Barker, an award-winning director  Film companies who directed other videos for the group include Fifty Fifty Films and Head Pictures   Powderfinger was highly successful in the Australian recording industry, being a recipient of the industry's flagship awards, the ARIA Music Awards, 18 times from 47 nominations – the third-highest behind Silverchair's 21 wins from 49 nominations and John Farnham 's 20 wins from 56 nominations  Powderfinger's most successful year was 2001 , when they won six awards from eight nominations for Odyssey Number Five and its related singles  These Days and My Happiness were ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 lists in 1999 and 2000 respectively, and 21 other Powderfinger tracks have ranked on lists in other years   In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Powderfinger were announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for their role as Influential Artists   General  Specific     Joseph Maurice Ravel ( French:  ; 7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor  He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy , although both composers rejected the term  In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer   Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire ; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal  After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of modernism, baroque , neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz . He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development  He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known   A slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries  Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music  Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration  Some of his piano music, such as Gaspard de la nuit (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chloé (1912) require skilful balance in performance   Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public  From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision   Ravel was born in the Basque town of Ciboure , France, near Biarritz , 18 kilometres (11 mi) from the Spanish border  His father, Pierre-Joseph Ravel , was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in Versoix near the Franco-Swiss border  His mother, Marie, née Delouart, was Basque but had grown up in Madrid  In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status – Marie was illegitimate and barely literate – but the marriage was a happy one  Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early internal combustion engine and a notorious circus machine, the Whirlwind of Death, an automotive loop-the-loop that was a major attraction until a fatal accident at Barnum and Bailey's Circus in 1903   Both Ravel's parents were Roman Catholics ; Marie was also something of a free-thinker , a trait inherited by her elder son  He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born  The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born  (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession ) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music  Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him  The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods   Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general  In later life, Ravel recalled, Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music  My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age  There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father   When he was seven, Ravel started piano lessons with Henry Ghys, a friend of Emmanuel Chabrier ; five years later, in 1887, he began studying harmony , counterpoint and composition with Charles-René, a pupil of Léo Delibes . Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy  Charles-René found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort  Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by Schumann , variations on a theme by Grieg and a single movement of a piano sonata  They survive only in fragmentary form   In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist Ricardo Viñes , who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music  The two shared an appreciation of Wagner , Russian music, and the writings of Poe , Baudelaire and Mallarmé . At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov . This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy , as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan , also heard during the Exposition   Émile Decombes took over as Ravel's piano teacher in 1889; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance  Aged fourteen, he took part in a concert at the Salle Érard along with other pupils of Decombes, including Reynaldo Hahn and Alfred Cortot .  With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the Conservatoire de Paris . In November 1889, playing music by Chopin , he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eugène Anthiome  Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student  Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer  The musicologist Arbie Orenstein writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period of immense growth   ... from adolescence to maturity   In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot , for piano, and Émile Pessard , for harmony  He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from Bériot but, in the words of the musicologist Barbara L. Kelly , he was only teachable on his own terms  His later teacher Gabriel Fauré understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s  Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes  His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: Sérénade grotesque , for piano, and Ballade de la Reine morte d'aimer, a mélodie setting a poem by Roland de Marès (both 1893).  Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Viñes and Cortot were  It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer  From this point he concentrated on composition  His works from the period include the songs Un grand sommeil noir and D'Anne jouant de l'espinette to words by Paul Verlaine and Clément Marot , and the piano pieces Menuet antique and Habanera (for four hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the Rapsodie espagnole . At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie , who was earning a living as a café pianist  Ravel was one of the first musicians – Debussy was another – who recognised Satie's originality and talent  Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them of inestimable value   In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with Fauré, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with André Gedalge . Both these teachers, particularly Fauré, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer  As Ravel's course progressed, Fauré reported a distinct gain in maturity   ... engaging wealth of imagination  Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, Théodore Dubois , who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook  Consequently, according to a fellow student, Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi , he was a marked man, against whom all weapons were good  He wrote some substantial works while studying with Fauré, including the overture Shéhérazade and a violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900  As a former student he was allowed to attend Fauré's classes as a non-participating auditeur until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903   In 1899 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: Pavane pour une infante défunte ( Pavane for a dead princess). It was originally a solo piano work, commissioned by the Princesse de Polignac . In 1897 he conducted the first performance of the Shéhérazade overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics  One described the piece as a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School and called Ravel a mediocrely gifted debutant   ... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years, if he works hard  Another critic, Pierre Lalo , thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven . Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic   From the start of his career, Ravel appeared calmly indifferent to blame or praise  Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine  The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own, perfectionist and severely self-critical  At twenty years of age he was, in the words of the biographer Burnett James, self-possessed, a little aloof, intellectually biased, given to mild banter  He dressed like a dandy and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour  Orenstein comments that, short in stature, light in frame and bony in features, Ravel had the appearance of a well-dressed jockey, whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect  During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century, Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day; from his mid-thirties he was clean-shaven   Around 1900 Ravel and a number of innovative young artists, poets, critics and musicians joined together in an informal group; they came to be known as Les Apaches (The Hooligans), a name coined by Viñes to represent their status as artistic outcasts  They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War, and members stimulated one another with intellectual argument and performances of their works  The membership of the group was fluid, and at various times included Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla as well as their French friends   Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy  Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued for more than ten years  In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique . It divided musical opinion  Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece  The Apaches were loud in their support  The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them   Debussy was widely held to be an impressionist composer – a label he intensely disliked  Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre  Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not  Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship  Ravel wrote that Debussy's genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition  For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy   ... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of symbolism . During the first years of the new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece Jeux d'eau (1901), the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works  Nichols calls the quartet at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence   The two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons  Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other  Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom  Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people  The public tension led to personal estrangement  Ravel said, It's probably better for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons  Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift  In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer Emma Bardac . Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante Misia Edwards and the opera star Lucienne Bréval , contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband    During the first years of the new century Ravel made five attempts to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome , past winners of which included Berlioz , Gounod , Bizet , Massenet and Debussy  In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition  In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy , the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies  In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a furore . He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable  The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu , was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received  L'affaire Ravel became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire   Among those taking a close interest in the controversy was Alfred Edwards , owner and editor of Le Matin , for which Lalo wrote  Edwards was married to Ravel's friend Misia; the couple took Ravel on a seven-week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905, the first time he had travelled abroad   By the latter part of the 1900s Ravel had established a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra  He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed  There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters  The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestrated 1910), Une barque sur l'océan (1906, from the 1905 piano suite Miroirs ), the Habanera section of Rapsodie espagnole (1907–08), Ma mère l'Oye (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911, orchestrated 1912), Alborada del gracioso (from Miroirs , orchestrated 1918) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).  Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them  Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent  Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters  He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound  When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity  The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams , who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08  Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner   ... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto   Vaughan Williams's recollections throw some light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation  Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels, Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women  By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange . Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual  Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry ; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery   Ravel's first concert outside France was in 1909  As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Société des Concerts Français, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation   The Société Nationale de Musique , founded in 1871 to promote the music of rising French composers, had been dominated since the mid-1880s by a conservative faction led by Vincent d'Indy . Ravel, together with several other former pupils of Fauré, set up a new, modernist organisation, the Société Musicale Indépendente, with Fauré as its president  The new society's inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Fauré's song cycle La chanson d'Ève , Debussy's piano suite D'un cahier d'esquisses , Zoltán Kodály 's Six pièces pour piano and the original piano duet version of Ravel's Ma mère l'Oye . The performers included Fauré, Florent Schmitt , Ernest Bloch , Pierre Monteux and, in the Debussy work, Ravel  Kelly considers it a sign of Ravel's new influence that the society featured Satie's music in a concert in January 1911   The first of Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy L'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911  The work had been completed in 1907, but the manager of the Opéra-Comique, Albert Carré , repeatedly deferred its presentation  He was concerned that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the Opéra-Comique's audience  The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular   In 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered  The first, to the orchestrated and expanded version of Ma mère l'Oye , opened at the Théâtre des Arts in January  The reviews were excellent: the Mercure de France called the score absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature  The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the Queen's Hall , London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year  The Times praised the enchantment of the work   ... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing  New York audiences heard the work in the same year  Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was Adélaïde ou le langage des fleurs , danced to the score of Valses nobles et sentimentales , which opened at the Châtelet in April  Daphnis et Chloé opened at the same theatre in June  This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete   Daphnis et Chloé was commissioned in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes . Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine , and designer, Léon Bakst . Fokine had a reputation for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music  This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music  There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work  It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London  The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere   Ravel composed little during 1913  He collaborated with Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky 's unfinished opera Khovanshchina , and his own works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier . In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of The Rite of Spring . Stravinsky later said that Ravel was the only person who immediately understood the music  Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande .  When Germany invaded France in 1914 Ravel tried to join the French Air Force . He considered his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator, but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint  While waiting to be enlisted, Ravel composed Trois Chansons , his only work for a cappella choir, setting his own texts in the tradition of French 16th-century chansons  He dedicated the three songs to people who might help him to enlist  After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist, Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915, when he was forty  Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend's courage: at his age and with his name he could have had an easier place, or done nothing  Some of Ravel's duties put him in mortal danger, driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment  At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother's failing health  His own health also deteriorated; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems, underwent a bowel operation following amoebic dysentery in September 1916, and had frostbite in his feet the following winter   During the war, the Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française was formed by Saint-Saëns, Dubois, d'Indy and others, campaigning for a ban on the performance of contemporary German music  Ravel declined to join, telling the committee of the league in 1916, It would be dangerous for French composers to ignore systematically the productions of their foreign colleagues, and thus form themselves into a sort of national coterie: our musical art, which is so rich at the present time, would soon degenerate, becoming isolated in banal formulas  The league responded by banning Ravel's music from its concerts   Ravel's mother died in January 1917, and he fell into a horrible despair, compounding the distress he felt at the suffering endured by the people of his country during the war  He composed few works in the war years  The Piano Trio was almost complete when the conflict began, and the most substantial of his wartime works is Le tombeau de Couperin , composed between 1914 and 1917  The suite celebrates the tradition of François Couperin , the 18th-century French composer; each movement is dedicated to a friend of Ravel's who died in the war   After the war, those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina  As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, Ravel's emotional equilibrium, so hard won in the previous decade, had been seriously compromised  His output, never large, became smaller  Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era  Fauré wrote to him, I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly  It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor  Ravel was offered the Legion of Honour in 1920, and although he declined the decoration, he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie's protégés Les Six as an establishment figure  Satie had turned against him, and commented, Ravel refuses the Légion d'honneur, but all his music accepts it  Despite this attack, Ravel continued to admire Satie's early music, and always acknowledged the older man's influence on his own development  Ravel took a benign view of Les Six, promoting their music, and defending it against journalistic attacks  He regarded their reaction against his works as natural, and preferable to their copying his style  Through the Société Musicale Indépendente, he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries  The Société presented concerts of recent works by American composers including Aaron Copland , Virgil Thomson and George Antheil and by Vaughan Williams and his English colleagues Arnold Bax and Cyril Scott .  Orenstein and Zank both comment that, although Ravel's post-war output was small, averaging only one composition a year, it included some of his finest works  In 1920 he completed La valse , in response to a commission from Diaghilev  He had worked on it intermittently for some years, planning a concert piece, a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz, mingled with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, fatal whirling  It was rejected by Diaghilev, who said, It's a masterpiece, but it's not a ballet  It's the portrait of a ballet  Ravel heard Diaghilev's verdict without protest or argument, left, and had no further dealings with him  Nichols comments that Ravel had the satisfaction of seeing the ballet staged twice by other managements before Diaghilev died  A ballet danced to the orchestral version of Le tombeau de Couperin was given at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in November 1920, and the premiere of La valse followed in December  The following year Daphnis et Chloé and L'heure espagnole were successfully revived at the Paris Opéra   In the post-war era there was a reaction against the large-scale music of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss . Stravinsky, whose Rite of Spring was written for a huge orchestra, began to work on a much smaller scale  His 1923 ballet score Les noces is composed for voices and twenty-one instruments  Ravel did not like the work (his opinion caused a cooling in Stravinsky's friendship with him) but he was in sympathy with the fashion for dépouillement – the stripping away of pre-war extravagance to reveal the essentials  Many of his works from the 1920s are noticeably sparer in texture than earlier pieces  Other influences on him in this period were jazz and atonality . Jazz was popular in Parisian cafés, and French composers such as Darius Milhaud incorporated elements of it in their work  Ravel commented that he preferred jazz to grand opera , and its influence is heard in his later music  Arnold Schönberg 's abandonment of conventional tonality also had echoes in some of Ravel's music such as the Chansons madécasses (1926), which Ravel doubted he could have written without the example of Pierrot Lunaire . His other major works from the 1920s include the orchestral arrangement of Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition (1922), the opera L'enfant et les sortilèges to a libretto by Colette (1926), Tzigane (1924) and the Violin Sonata (1927).  Finding city life fatiguing, Ravel moved to the countryside  In May 1921 he took up residence at Le Belvédère, a small house on the fringe of Montfort-l'Amaury , 50 kilometres (31 mi) west of Paris, in the Yvelines département . Looked after by a devoted housekeeper, Mme Revelot, he lived there for the rest of his life  At Le Belvédère Ravel composed and gardened, when not performing in Paris or abroad  His touring schedule increased considerably in the 1920s, with concerts in Britain, Sweden, Denmark, the US, Canada, Spain, Austria and Italy   Arbie Orenstein  After two months of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting  His fee was a guaranteed minimum of $ 10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes  He appeared with most of the leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities  Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary  At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York, the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat  Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed, You know, this doesn't happen to me in Paris  Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel's international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe's house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon . Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity  He commented that the critics' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, when they called him the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion   The last composition Ravel completed in the 1920s, Boléro , became his most famous  He was commissioned to provide a score for Ida Rubinstein 's ballet company, and having been unable to secure the rights to orchestrate Albéniz 's Iberia , he decided on an experiment in a very special and limited direction   ... a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of orchestral tissue without music  Ravel continued that the work was one long, very gradual crescendo  There are no contrasts, and there is practically no invention except the plan and the manner of the execution  The themes are altogether impersonal  He was astonished, and not wholly pleased, that it became a mass success  When one elderly member of the audience at the Opéra shouted Rubbish  at the premiere, he remarked, That old lady got the message  The work was popularised by the conductor Arturo Toscanini , and has been recorded several hundred times  Ravel commented to Arthur Honegger , one of Les Six, I've written only one masterpiece – Boléro . Unfortunately there's no music in it   At the beginning of the 1930s Ravel was working on two piano concertos  He completed the Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand first  It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein , who had lost his right arm during the war  Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project: In a work of this kind, it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands  Ravel, not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand, demonstrated it with both hands  Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece, but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work  In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim, and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year  The critic Henry Prunières wrote, From the opening measures, we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us   The Piano Concerto in G major was completed a year later  After the premiere in January 1932 there was high praise for the soloist, Marguerite Long, and for Ravel's score, though not for his conducting  Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting; they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted   Igor Stravinsky  In October 1932 Ravel suffered a blow to the head in a taxi accident  The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition  As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia . Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score  Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée . The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription  Ravel composed no more after this  The exact nature of his illness is unknown  Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour , and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia , Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease . Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months  Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head   In 1937 Ravel began to suffer pain from his condition, and was examined by Clovis Vincent , a well-known Paris neurosurgeon  Vincent advised surgical treatment  He thought a tumour unlikely, and expected to find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing  Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view  After the operation there seemed to be an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma  He died on 28 December, at the age of 62   On 30 December 1937 Ravel was interred next to his parents in a granite tomb at Levallois-Perret cemetery , in north-west Paris  He was an atheist and there was no religious ceremony   Marcel Marnat 's catalogue of Ravel's complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned  Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries, it is nevertheless inflated by Ravel's frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra  The performable body of works numbers about sixty; slightly more than half are instrumental  Ravel's music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera and song cycles  He wrote no symphonies or church works   Ravel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy  Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert , Liszt and Chopin  He considered himself in many ways a classicist , often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary , to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies  The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata   Ravel to Vaughan Williams  Ravel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is an implied melodic outline in all vital music  His themes are frequently modal instead of using the familiar major or minor scales  As a result, there are few leading notes in his output  Chords of the ninth and eleventh and unresolved appoggiaturas , such as those in the Valses nobles et sentimentales , are characteristic of Ravel's harmonic language   Dance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the bolero and pavane, but also the minuet , forlane , rigaudon , waltz , czardas , habanera and passacaglia . National and regional consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to Hebraic , Greek , Hungarian and gypsy themes  He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired – Borodin , Chabrier, Fauré and Haydn , interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style  Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion, with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude   Ravel completed two operas, and worked on three others  The unrealised three were Olympia , La cloche engloutie and Jeanne d'Arc . Olympia was to be based on Hoffmann 's The Sandman ; he made sketches for it in 1898–99, but did not progress far  La cloche engloutie after Hauptmann 's The Sunken Bell occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912, Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works, except for a Symphonie horlogère which he incorporated into the opening of L'heure espagnole . The third unrealised project was an operatic version of Joseph Delteil 's 1925 novel about Joan of Arc . It was to be a large-scale, full-length work for the Paris Opéra, but Ravel's final illness prevented him from writing it   Ravel's first completed opera was L'heure espagnole (premiered in 1911), described as a comédie musicale  It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career  Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects  Edward Burlingame Hill found Ravel's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action, and commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage  Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity  The critic David Murray writes that the score glows with the famous Ravel tendresse .  The second opera, also in one act, is L'enfant et les sortilèges (1926), a fantaisie lyrique to a libretto by Colette  She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto  It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than L'heure espagnole , and the jazz elements and bitonality of much of the work upset many Parisian opera-goers  Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work  The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout   Although one-act operas are generally staged less often than full-length ones, Ravel's are produced regularly in France and abroad   A substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal  His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome  His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as a static, recitative-like vocal style, prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility  By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in Histoires naturelles . The same technique is highlighted in Trois poèmes de Mallarmé (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided  In the cycles Shéhérazade and Chansons madécasses , Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment   Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as Cinq mélodies populaires grecques , Deux mélodies hébraïques and Chants populaires . Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue , Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine  For three songs dating from 1914–15, he wrote his own texts   Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices  Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade , to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score   During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous  He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use  The critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote, In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a pp tam-tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another   For all Ravel's orchestral mastery, only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra: Rapsodie espagnole , La valse and the two concertos  All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in Daphnis et Chloé , or as a reworking of piano pieces, Alborada del gracioso and Une barque sur l'ocean , ( Miroirs ), Valses nobles et sentimentales, Ma mère l'Oye , Tzigane (originally for violin and piano) and Le tombeau de Couperin  In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms  Occasionally, as in the Alborada del gracioso , critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original   In some of his scores from the 1920s, including Daphnis et Chloé , Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six to eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility  His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points  In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures  The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of Mozart and Saint-Saëns, alongside use of jazz-like themes  The critics Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor comment that in the slow movement, one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented, the composer can truly be said to join hands with Mozart  The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, Boléro (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm   Ravel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann, Chabrier, Debussy and Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition . Orchestral versions of the last by Mikhail Tushmalov , Sir Henry Wood and Leo Funtek predated Ravel's 1922 version, and many more have been made since, but Ravel's remains the best known  Kelly remarks on its dazzling array of instrumental colour, and a contemporary reviewer commented on how, in dealing with another composer's music, Ravel had produced an orchestral sound wholly unlike his own   Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch from the striking simplicity of Ma mère l'Oye to the transcendental virtuosity of Gaspard de la nuit . Ravel's earliest major work for piano, Jeux d'eau (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later  When writing for solo piano, Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity  The authors of The Record Guide consider that works such as Gaspard de la Nuit and Miroirs have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself   Most of Ravel's piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges  Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing  It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in Alborada del gracioso   ... and the two outer movements of Gaspard de la nuit . Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale  This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in Gaspard de la nuit , Le gibet would bore the audience to death  Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing   Ravel's regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works; Menuet sur le nom de Haydn (1909), À la manière de Borodine (1912), À la manière de Chabrier (1913) and Le tombeau de Couperin all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically Ravellian manner  Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions: Listen to Le tombeau de Couperin and the complete ballet music for Ma mère L'Oye in the classic recordings conducted by André Cluytens , and the piano versions never sound quite the same again   Apart from a one-movement sonata for violin and piano dating from 1899, unpublished in the composer's lifetime, Ravel wrote seven chamber works  The earliest is the String Quartet (1902–03), dedicated to Fauré, and showing the influence of Debussy's quartet of ten years earlier  Like the Debussy, it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers, with more succinct melodies, fluently interchanged, in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour  The Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet (1905) was composed very quickly by Ravel's standards  It is an ethereal piece in the vein of the Pavane pour une infante défunte . Ravel also worked at unusual speed on the Piano Trio (1914) to complete it before joining the French Army  It contains Basque, Baroque and far Eastern influences, and shows Ravel's growing technical skill, dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello, blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own, in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson   Ravel's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920–22), the Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Fauré for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of Tzigane for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923–27). The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel's teacher, and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist Jelly d'Arányi . The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody  His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work  Ravel said that the violin and piano are essentially incompatible instruments, and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility  Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor consider the post-war sonatas rather laboured and unsatisfactory, and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel's pre-war chamber works   Ravel's interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on piano roll between 1914 and 1928, although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by Robert Casadesus , a better pianist  Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc  In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of Jeux d'eau played by Mark Hambourg , and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the Pavane pour une infante défunte and Ondine , and movements from the String Quartet, Le tombeau de Couperin and Ma mère l'Oye . Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public, and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works, some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor  A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as Conducted by the composer, although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton  Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a Boléro in 1930, and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist   Ravel declined not only the Légion d'honneur, but all state honours from France, refusing to let his name go forward for election to the Institut de France . He accepted foreign awards, including honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921, the Belgian Ordre de Léopold in 1926, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1928   After Ravel's death, his brother and legatee, Edouard, turned the composer's house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it  As of 2018 the maison-musée de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours   In his later years, Edouard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind  After his death in 1960, the estate passed through several hands  Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were  The British newspaper The Guardian reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair      Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns ( French:  ; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era . His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (Organ) Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886).  Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten  After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri , Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine , the official church of the French Empire . After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas   As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann , Liszt and Wagner , although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition  He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers  This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six , he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death   Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years  It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré , among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel . Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius   Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin  Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris , and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice , always considered himself a true Parisian  Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption (tuberculosis) on the first anniversary of his marriage  The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil , 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris   When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson  Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano  His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty , a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner . Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training  Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young  The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart  The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel , in a programme that included Mozart 's Piano Concerto in B ♭ ( K 450), and Beethoven 's Third Piano Concerto . Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher Alexandre Pierre François Boëly . From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of Bach , which was then little known in France   As a schoolboy Saint-Saëns was outstanding in many subjects  In addition to his musical prowess, he distinguished himself in the study of French literature, Latin and Greek, divinity, and mathematics  His interests included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life   In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire , France's foremost music academy  The director, Daniel Auber , had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative  Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist  His organ professor was François Benoist , whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam , César Franck , Charles Alkan , Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet . In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies  His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy , whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet   Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo . He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome , in 1852 but was unsuccessful  Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen , who made little mark during the rest of his career  In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile , for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize  The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).  On leaving the Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns accepted the post of organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville . The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year there were more than two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income  The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot , had been badly damaged in the aftermath of the French Revolution and imperfectly restored  The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered  With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E ♭ (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire . The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile   Among the musicians who were quick to spot Saint-Saëns's talent were the composers Gioachino Rossini , Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt , and the influential singer Pauline Viardot , who all encouraged him in his career  In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of La Madeleine , the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world   Although in later life he had a reputation for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner . Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions  He commented, I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character  They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me  But I am not, I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion   In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France  Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies  He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner  His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré , recalled in old age:  After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known  ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I had for him, throughout my life   Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager ). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals , with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school   In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome  Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer  He was once more unsuccessful  Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote:  We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy  We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing  I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity  But the other man, who is still a student, has that inner fire, inspiration, he feels, he can do things that can't be learnt and the rest he'll learn more or less  So I voted for him, sighing at the thought of the unhappiness that this failure must cause Saint-Saëns  But, whatever else, one must be honest   According to the musical scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his well-known bon mot about Saint-Saëns, He knows everything, but lacks inexperience (Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience). The winner, Victor Sieg , had a career no more notable than that of the 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency  The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation  He himself wrote, Art is intended to create beauty and character  Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it  In fact, it is very much better off when it does  The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul  The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius, and Bad music well written   While teaching at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of his energy into composing and performing, but after he left in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with vigour  In 1867 his cantata Les noces de Prométhée beat more than a hundred other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi . In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his Second Piano Concerto . Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s   In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine , professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music  Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out  Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war  During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871  With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals  Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society  The Société Nationale de Musique , with its motto, Ars Gallica , had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc , Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members   As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems , Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first poème symphonique was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872  In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged  La princesse jaune (The Yellow Princess), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique , Paris in June  It ran for five performances   Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother  In 1875, he surprised many by marrying  The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils  The marriage was not a success  In the words of the biographer Sabina Teller Ratner, Saint-Saëns's mother disapproved, and her son was difficult to live with  Saint-Saëns and his wife moved to the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince , in the Latin Quarter ; his mother moved with them  The couple had two sons, both of whom died in infancy  In 1878, the elder, André, aged two, fell from a window of the flat and was killed; the younger, Jean-François, died of pneumonia six weeks later, aged six months  Saint-Saëns and Marie-Laure continued to live together for three years, but he blamed her for André's accident; the double blow of their loss effectively destroyed the marriage   For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music  Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere  In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged  His four-act drame lyricque, Le timbre d'argent (The Silver Bell), to Jules Barbier 's and Michel Carré 's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production  The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances   The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition  Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died  He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities  After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all  He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted   In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila , his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire  Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation  Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892   Saint-Saëns was a keen traveller  From the 1870s until the end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries  His professional engagements took him most often to Germany and England; for holidays, and to avoid Parisian winters which affected his weak chest, he favoured Algiers and various places in Egypt   Saint-Saëns was elected to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878  In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday  On 28 July he disappeared from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say that he would not be returning  They never saw each other again  Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five  Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman  Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women  After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle  Marie told him, For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here   In the 1880s Saint-Saëns continued to seek success in the opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it was unthinkable that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera  He had two operas staged during the decade, the first being Henry VIII (1883) commissioned by the Paris Opéra  Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Saëns, normally a fluent, even facile composer, worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England  The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer's lifetime  When it was produced at Covent Garden in 1898, The Era commented that though French librettists generally make a pretty hash of British history, this piece was not altogether contemptible as an opera story   The open-mindedness of the Société Nationale had hardened by the mid-1880s into a dogmatic adherence to Wagnerian methods favoured by Franck's pupils, led by Vincent d'Indy . They had begun to dominate the organisation and sought to abandon its Ars Gallica ethos of commitment to French works  Bussine and Saint-Saëns found this unacceptable, and resigned in 1886  Having long pressed the merits of Wagner on a sometimes sceptical French public, Saint-Saëns was now becoming worried that the German's music was having an excessive impact on young French composers  His increasing caution towards Wagner developed in later years into stronger hostility, directed as much at Wagner's political nationalism as at his music   By the 1880s Saint-Saëns was an established favourite with audiences in England, where he was widely regarded as the greatest living French composer  In 1886 the Philharmonic Society of London commissioned what became one of his most popular and respected works, the Third (Organ) Symphony . It was premiered in London at a concert in which Saint-Saëns appeared as conductor of the symphony and as soloist in Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto , conducted by Sir Arthur Sullivan . The success of the symphony in London was considerable, but was surpassed by the ecstatic welcome the work received at its Paris premiere early the following year  Later in 1887 Saint-Saëns's drame lyrique Proserpine opened at the Opéra-Comique  It was well received and seemed to be heading for a substantial run when the theatre burnt down within weeks of the premiere and the production was lost   In December 1888 Saint-Saëns's mother died  He felt her loss deeply, and was plunged into depression and insomnia, even contemplating suicide  He left Paris and stayed in Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose   During the 1890s Saint-Saëns spent much time on holiday, travelling overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before  A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell through in 1893  He wrote one opera, the comedy Phryné (1893), and together with Paul Dukas helped to complete Frédégonde (1895) an opera left unfinished by Ernest Guiraud , who died in 1892  Phryné was well received, and prompted calls for more comic operas at the Opéra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring grand opera . His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement fantasia Africa (1891) and his Fifth (Egyptian) Piano Concerto , which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his début at the Salle Pleyel in 1846  Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother's tutelage and his public's long support   Among the concerts that Saint-Saëns undertook during the decade was one at Cambridge in June 1893, when he, Bruch and Tchaikovsky performed at an event presented by Charles Villiers Stanford for the Cambridge University Musical Society , marking the award of honorary degrees to all three visitors  Saint-Saëns greatly enjoyed the visit, and even spoke approvingly of the college chapel services: The demands of English religion are not excessive  The services are very short, and consist chiefly of listening to good music extremely well sung, for the English are excellent choristers  His mutual regard for British choirs continued for the rest of his life, and one of his last large-scale works, the oratorio The Promised Land , was composed for the Three Choirs Festival of 1913   In 1900, after ten years without a permanent home in Paris, Saint-Saëns took a flat in the rue de Courcelles, not far from his old residence in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré  This remained his home for the rest of his life  He continued to travel abroad frequently, but increasingly often to give concerts rather than as a tourist  He revisited London, where he was always a welcome visitor, went to Berlin, where until the First World War, he was greeted with honour, and travelled in Italy, Spain, Monaco and provincial France  In 1906 and 1909 he made highly successful tours of the United States, as a pianist and conductor  In New York on his second visit he premiered his Praise ye the Lord for double choir, orchestra and organ, which he composed for the occasion   Despite his growing reputation as a musical reactionary, Saint-Saëns was, according to Gallois, probably the only French musician who travelled to Munich to hear the premiere of Mahler 's Eighth Symphony in 1910  Nonetheless, by the 20th century Saint-Saëns had lost much of his enthusiasm for modernism in music  Though he strove to conceal it from Fauré, he did not understand or like the latter's opera Pénélope (1913), of which he was the dedicatee  In 1917 Francis Poulenc , at the beginning of his career as a composer, was dismissive when Ravel praised Saint-Saëns as a genius  By this time, various strands of new music were emerging with which Saint-Saëns had little in common  His classical instincts for form put him at odds with what seemed to him the shapelessness and structure of the musical impressionists, led by Debussy  Nor did the theories of Arnold Schönberg 's dodecaphony commend themselves to Saint-Saëns:  There is no longer any question of adding to the old rules new principles which are the natural expression of time and experience, but simply of casting aside all rules and every restraint  Everyone ought to make his own rules  Music is free and unlimited in its liberty of expression  There are no perfect chords, dissonant chords or false chords  All aggregations of notes are legitimate  That is called, and they believe it, the development of taste .  Holding such conservative views, Saint-Saëns was out of sympathy – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty  It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky 's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913  In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane   When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music during the First World War, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with their old teacher  They were privately concerned that their friend was in danger of looking foolish with his excess of patriotism, and his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy's En blanc et noir (1915): We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the cubist pictures  His determination to block Debussy's candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer's supporters  Saint-Saëns's response to the neoclassicism of Les Six was equally uncompromising: of Darius Milhaud 's polytonal symphonic suite Protée (1919) he commented, fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France   Saint-Saëns gave what he intended to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance as a result of the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities  These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German warships   In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut for a large invited audience; it was remarked that his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his personal bearing was admirable for a man of eighty-six  He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do  While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921  His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the cimetière du Montparnasse . Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881   In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Saëns in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians wrote:  Saint-Saëns is a consummate master of composition, and no one possesses a more profound knowledge than he does of the secrets and resources of the art; but the creative faculty does not keep pace with the technical skill of the workman  His incomparable talent for orchestration enables him to give relief to ideas which would otherwise be crude and mediocre in themselves ... his works are on the one hand not frivolous enough to become popular in the widest sense, nor on the other do they take hold of the public by that sincerity and warmth of feeling which is so convincing   Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saëns was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past  In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic D   C   Parker wrote, That Saint-Saëns knows Rameau   ... Bach and Handel , Haydn and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings  His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art   Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Saëns often favoured self-contained melodies  Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, supple and pliable, more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the phrase pattern AABB is characteristic  An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him  Grove observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring  In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar  Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although Grove points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works   The authors of the 1955 The Record Guide , Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor write that Saint-Saëns's brilliant musicianship was instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the fact that there are other forms of music besides opera  In the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary , Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Saëns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c.1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia  Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable  The Urbs Roma Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and thick and heavy in its effect  Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of fugal writing  The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ  It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune  The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Saëns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885). The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring motif treated in a Lisztian style of thematic transformation .  Saint-Saëns's four symphonic poems follow the model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the vulgar blatancy to which the earlier composer was prone  The most popular of the four is Danse macabre (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight  Saint-Saëns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation, but in this piece he featured the xylophone prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers  Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871) was composed soon after the horrors of the Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies  Rees rates Phaëton (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer's professed indifference to melody, and inspired in its depiction of the mythical hero and his fate  A critic at the time of the premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece  The last of the four symphonic poems, La jeunesse d'Hercule (Hercules's Youth, 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful  In the judgment of the critic Roger Nichols these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel   Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, Javot (1896), the score for the film L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), and incidental music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916  Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier .  Saint-Saëns was the first major French composer to write piano concertos  His First , in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the Second , in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works  The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary sonata form first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn cadenza . The scherzo second movement and presto finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist Zygmunt Stojowski commented that the work begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach  The Third Piano Concerto , in E ♭ (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines  The Fourth , in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second  It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos  According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns the Beethoven of France (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor  The work is known as the Egyptian concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in Luxor , and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing   The First Cello Concerto , in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section  It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by Pablo Casals and later players  The Second , in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections  It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saint-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult  There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's Second , in C major  The First, in A, was also completed in 1858  It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour  The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime  The Third , in B minor, written for Pablo de Sarasate , is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity  It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso , in A minor, Op  28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863  It changes from a wistful and tense opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, After a multi-stopped cadenza ... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major   Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde , Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques . During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work  The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior  In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics  Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune , which Harding describes as like Sullivan with a light French touch   Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s  In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content   ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable  Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models  From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs , which, like Massenet, he used sparingly  Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less variety of tempo within individual numbers  In a survey of recorded opera Alan Blyth writes that Saint-Saëns certainly learned much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of Aida , and Wagner, but from these excellent models he forged his own style   From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies , writing more than 140  He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder . Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (Persian Songs, 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (The Red Ash Tree, 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo ; others included Alphonse de Lamartine , Pierre Corneille , Amable Tastu , and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet  He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable  Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including Le lever du soleil sur le Nil (Sunrise over the Nile, 1898) and Hymne à la paix (Hymn to Peace, 1919), are for voice and orchestra  His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy .  Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios  Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein . He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence , of oratorio  He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra  In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre  In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Saëns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it   Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark  Nichols excepts the Étude en forme de valse (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique  Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed the French Beethoven, and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E ♭ (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas  He is not known even to have contemplated writing one  There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns's works for the piano are single short pieces  In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as Souvenir d'Italie (1887), Les cloches du soir (Evening bells, 1889) and Souvenir d'Ismaïlia (1895).  Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo  Some of them were written for use in church services – Offertoire (1853), Bénédiction nuptiale (1859), Communion (1859) and others  After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former   Saint-Saëns wrote more than forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years  One of the first of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, confident piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other cantabile . The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms  At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of baroque composers including Rameau and Lully .  Sabina Teller Ratner, 2005  In Ratner's view, the most important of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment  The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by Grove's Dictionary as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions  The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards  The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier  It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment  Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance  The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo   The woodwind sonatas are among the composer's last works  Ratner writes of them, The spare, evocative, classical lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement  Gallois comments that the Oboe Sonata begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of tarantella . For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata is the most important of the three: he calls it a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism amounting to a summary of the rest  The work contrasts a doleful threnody  in the slow movement with the finale, which pirouettes in 4/4 time, in a style reminiscent of the 18th century  The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata a model of transparency, vitality and lightness, containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation   The composer's most famous work, The Carnival of the Animals (1887), although far from a typical chamber piece, is written for eleven players, and is considered by Grove's Dictionary to be part of Saint-Saëns's chamber output  Grove rates it as his most brilliant comic work, parodying Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Rossini, his own Danse macabre and several popular tunes  He forbade performances of it during his lifetime, concerned that its frivolity would damage his reputation as a serious composer   Saint-Saëns was a pioneer in recorded music  In June 1904 The Gramophone Company of London sent its producer Fred Gaisberg to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the mezzo-soprano Meyriane Héglon in arias from Ascanio and Samson et Dalila , and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra). Saint-Saëns made more recordings for the company in 1919   In the early days of the LP record , Saint-Saëns's works were patchily represented on disc  The Record Guide (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of Danse Macabre , The Carnival of the Animals , the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works  In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD  The 2008 Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Saëns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets  Also listed are an early Mass, collections of organ music, and choral songs  A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Saëns's mélodies was released in 1997   With the exception of Samson et Dalila the operas have been sparsely represented on disc  A recording of Henry VIII was issued on CD and DVD in 1992  Hélène was released on CD in 2008  There are several recordings of Samson et Dalilah , under conductors including Sir Colin Davis , Georges Prêtre , Daniel Barenboim and Myung-Whun Chung .  Saint-Saëns was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1867 and promoted to Officier in 1884, and Grand Croix in 1913  Foreign honours included the British Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1902, and honorary doctorates from the universities of Cambridge (1893) and Oxford (1907).  In its obituary notice, The Times commented:  The death of M. Saint-Saëns not only deprives France of one of her most distinguished composers; it removes from the world the last representative of the great movements in music which were typical of the 19th century  He had maintained so vigorous a vitality and kept in such close touch with present-day activities that, though it had become customary to speak of him as the doyen of French composers, it was easy to forget the place he actually took in musical chronology  He was only two years younger than Brahms, was five years older than Tchaikovsky, six years older than Dvořák , and seven years older than Sullivan  He held a position in his own country's music certain aspects of which may be fitly compared with each of those masters in their own spheres   In a short poem, Mea culpa, published in 1890 Saint-Saëns accused himself of lack of decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were not for him  An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day  The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form  The critic Henry Colles , wrote, a few days after the composer's death:  In his desire to maintain the perfect equilibrium we find the limitation of Saint-Saëns's appeal to the ordinary musical mind  Saint-Saëns rarely, if ever, takes any risks; he never, to use the slang of the moment, goes off the deep end  All his greatest contemporaries did  Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and even Franck, were ready to sacrifice everything for the end each wanted to reach, to drown in the attempt to get there if necessary  Saint-Saëns, in preserving his equilibrium, allows his hearers to preserve theirs   Grove concludes its article on Saint-Saëns with the observation that although his works are remarkably consistent, it cannot be said that he evolved a distinctive musical style  Rather, he defended the French tradition that threatened to be engulfed by Wagnerian influences and created the environment that nourished his successors   Since the composer's death writers sympathetic to his music have expressed regret that he is known by the musical public for only a handful of his scores such as The Carnival of the Animals , the Second Piano Concerto, the Third Violin Concerto, the Organ Symphony, Samson et Dalila , Danse macabre and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso  Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio , the ballet Javotte , the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces  In 2004, the cellist Steven Isserlis said, Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself ... there are Masses, all of which are interesting  I've played all his cello music and there isn't one bad piece  His works are rewarding in every way  And he's an endlessly fascinating figure      The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975  Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years, they are regarded as one of the most groundbreaking acts in the history of popular music . They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians  Their fashion and hairstyles have been credited as a significant influence on punk image , and they are often associated with anarchism within music   The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten , guitarist Steve Jones , drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock . Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977  Under the management of Malcolm McLaren , the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain  Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single  God Save the Queen , attacking Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they precipitated the punk rock movement  It was banned not only by the BBC but also by nearly every independent radio station, making it the most heavily censored record in British history   The band's only album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols (1977)—a UK number one album—is a staple record of punk rock  In January 1978, at the end of their over-hyped and turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten announced the band's break-up  Over the next few months, the three remaining band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex Pistols' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle . Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen . Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock briefly reunited for a concert tour in 1996   The Sex Pistols have been recognised as an influence on various genres, including grunge , indie , thrash metal and rap . In 2004, Rolling Stone placed them No  58 on its list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols—the four original members plus Vicious—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum a piss stain   The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar  According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments they had stolen  Early line-ups of The Strand—sometimes known as The Swankers—also included Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass  The band members regularly hung out at two clothing shops on the King's Road in Chelsea , London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor's Acme Attractions (where Don Letts worked as manager) and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood 's Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die  McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme  It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the 50's rocker look associated with Marlon Brando . As John Lydon later observed, Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto  The shop became a focal point of the punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious , Marco Pirroni , Gene October , and Mark Stewart , among many others  Jordan , the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look   In early 1974, Jones asked McLaren to manage The Strand  Effectively agreeing, McLaren paid for their first formal rehearsal space  Glen Matlock , an art student who occasionally worked at 'Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die', was recruited as the band's regular bassist  In November, McLaren temporarily relocated to New York City  Before his departure, McLaren and Westwood had conceived a new identity for their shop: renamed Sex , it changed its focus from retro couture to S&amp;M -inspired anti-fashion , with a billing as Specialists in rubberwear, glamourwear &amp; stagewear  After informally managing and promoting the New York Dolls for a few months, McLaren returned to London in May 1975  Inspired by the punk scene that was emerging in Lower Manhattan —in particular by the radical visual style and attitude of Richard Hell , then with Television —McLaren began taking a greater interest in The Strand members   The group had been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes , and had performed publicly for the first time  Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale was kicked out of the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties  According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones &amp; His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group  When those plans fell through, McLaren, Rhodes and the band began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties  As described by Matlock, Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so what we used to do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer  For instance, former singer with boy band Slik and future Ultravox front man Midge Ure claims to have been approached by McLaren, but to have refused the offer  With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation   In August 1975, Bernard Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old King's Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes  Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook  According to Jones, He came in with green hair  I thought he had a really interesting face  I liked his look  He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins  John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart  When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper 's  I'm Eighteen  on the shop jukebox  Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks  During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe  These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett  The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate  Waters commented: Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd   While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio  Thorgerson recalled that he sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there  He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him  Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience  Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth . Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US   In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space  In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals , in their newly finished 24-track studio  The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell 's political fable Animal Farm . The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep  Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station , over which they superimposed an image of a pig   The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis  Although Gilmour was largely responsible for Dogs, which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part  Pigs on the Wing . Wright commented: It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there  Mason recalled: Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately  Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album  Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals ; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering  Animals was the first Pink Floyd album with no writing credit for Wright, who said: This was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me   Released in January 1977, Animals peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three  NME described the album as one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music, and Melody Maker ' s Karl Dallas called it  uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific   Pink Floyd performed much of Animals during their  In the Flesh  tour  It was their first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band  Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance  On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to quit  At the Montreal Olympic Stadium , a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them  The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish   In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album  The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former  Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album  Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II . This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett  At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person   During the recording of The Wall , the band became dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution and fired him  Gilmour said that Wright was dismissed as he hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little  According to Mason, Wright would sit in on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'. Waters said the band agreed that Wright would either have to have a long battle or agree to leave quietly after the album was finished; Wright accepted the ultimatum and left   The Wall was supported by Pink Floyd's first single since Money,  Another Brick in the Wall (Part II) , which topped the charts in the US and the UK  The Wall was released on 30 November 1979 and topped the Billboard chart in the US for 15 weeks, reaching number three in the UK  It is number three on the RIAA 's list of the all-time Top 100 albums, with 23 million certified units sold in the US  The cover, with a stark brick wall and band name, was the first Pink Floyd album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis   Gerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the Wall tour  He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline, including the Mother, the Ex-wife and the Schoolmaster  Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances  Relationships within the band reached an all-time low; their four Winnebagos parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre  Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band  Wright returned as a paid musician, making him the only band member to profit from the tour, which lost about $600,000 (US$1,687,335 in 2019 dollars ).  The Wall was adapted into a film, Pink Floyd – The Wall . The film was conceived as a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved impractical to film  Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach  The animated sequences remained, but scenes were acted by actors with no dialogue  Waters was screentested, but quickly discarded and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the role of Pink  Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall ' s storyline as bollocks  Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed  Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd – The Wall premièred in the UK in July 1982   In 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks , originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall  With the onset of the Falklands War , Waters changed direction and began writing new material  He saw Margaret Thatcher 's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father  Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall . Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire  Michael Kamen , a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall , mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright  The tension within the band grew  Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure  After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions   Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album  With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure  Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself  Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US  Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album  Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused  Gilmour later commented: I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut . Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece  Loder viewed The Final Cut as essentially a Roger Waters solo album   Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face , in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters  He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd  Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity , which went almost unnoticed upon its release  Mason released his second solo album, Profiles , in August 1985   Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking , Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite  He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments  O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager  He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs  Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations  Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd  Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him  He went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd a spent force creatively   When Waters' lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name  Gilmour responded with a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist  The sides reached an out-of-court agreement, finalised on Gilmour's houseboat the Astoria on Christmas Eve 1987  In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members   In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason . There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions  Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence would make us stronger legally and musically, and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of $11,000   Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria , moored along the River Thames . The group found it difficult to work without Waters' creative direction; to write lyrics, Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough , eventually choosing Anthony Moore . Wright and Mason were out of practice; Gilmour said they had been destroyed by Roger, and their contributions were minimal   A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987  Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut , designed the album cover  To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle . The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US  Waters commented: I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate  Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: Roger's criticisms are fair  It's not a band album at all  Q magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album   Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name  Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral  Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice  Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them  As Pink Floyd toured North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances  Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig . Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design  The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall .  For several years Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event  In January 1993, they began working on a new album, The Division Bell , returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material  After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs  Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about 25 ideas   Contractually, Wright was not a member of the band, and said, It came close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album  However, he earned five co-writing credits, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here . Another songwriter credited on the album was Gilmour's future wife, Polly Samson . She helped him write several tracks, including  High Hopes , a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, pulled the whole album together, according to Ezrin  They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the album's orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned  Writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork  Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island ; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger  Eager to avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse , Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring  The Division Bell reached number 1 in the UK and the US, and spent 51 weeks on the UK chart   Pink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California , before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour  They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety  The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994  Mason published a memoir, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd , in 2004   On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24 years, at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park , London  The reunion was arranged by Live 8 organiser Bob Geldof ; after Gilmour declined the offer, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters  About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed  In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event   They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios  The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of the event  At the beginning of their performance of Wish You Were Here, Waters told the audience:  quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd  At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage  Waters called him back, and the band shared a group hug  Images of the hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity   Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136 million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only  However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen: The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in  It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that  It's just ... I've been there, I've done it  In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica , which declared: Patience for fans in mourning  The news is official  Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased  Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: It's over ... I've had enough  I'm 60 years old ... it is much more comfortable to work on my own  Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite   Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60  His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended  Wright said: The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death  Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire  Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to music  On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert Madcap's Last Laugh at the Barbican Centre in London  Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed the Barrett compositions  Bike  and Arnold Layne, and Waters performed a solo version of his song Flickering Flame   Wright died of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65  His former bandmates paid tributes to his life and work; Gilmour said: In the welter of arguments about who or what was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten  He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound  A week after Wright's death, Gilmour performed Remember a Day from A Saucerful of Secrets , written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute to him on BBC Two's Later .. with Jools Holland . Keyboardist Keith Emerson released a statement praising Wright as the backbone of Pink Floyd   On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation  The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, with an audience of approximately 200  In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour performed Comfortably Numb at Waters' performance of The Wall at the London O2 Arena on 12 May 2011, singing the choruses and playing the two guitar solos  Mason also joined, playing tambourine for  Outside the Wall  with Gilmour on mandolin   On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd ...   , reissuing the back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including Experience and Immersion multi-disc multi-format editions  The albums were remastered by James Guthrie , co-producer of The Wall . In November 2015, Pink Floyd released a limited edition EP, 1965: Their First Recordings , comprising six songs recorded prior to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn .  In 2012, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album  They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and generally harness studio technology  Waters was not involved  Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound  Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was   The Endless River was released on 7 November 2014, the second Pink Floyd album distributed by Parlophone following the release of the 20th anniversary editions of The Division Bell earlier in 2014  Though it received mixed reviews, it became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK and debuted at number one in several countries  The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997  Gilmour said The Endless River would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end  There was no supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was impossible without Wright  In 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were done and that to reunite without Wright would be wrong  Mason said in 2018 that Gilmour and Waters continued to be at loggerheads   In November 2016, Pink Floyd released a box set, The Early Years 1965–1972 , comprising outtakes, live recordings, remixes, and films from their early career  This was followed in December 2019 by The Later Years , compiling Pink Floyd's work after Waters' departure  The set includes a remixed version of A Momentary Lapse of Reason with more contributions by Wright and Mason, and an expanded reissue of the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder . In 2018, Mason formed a new band, Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets , to perform Pink Floyd's early material  The band includes Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet and longtime Pink Floyd collaborator Guy Pratt . They toured Europe in September 2018 and North America in 2019  Waters joined the band at the New York Beacon Theatre to perform vocals for  Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun .  Considered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, appearing at UFO Club and Middle Earth (club) . According to Rolling Stone : By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock , blues, country , folk , and electronic music . Released in 1968, the song Careful with That Axe, Eugene helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group  Other genres attributed to the band are space rock , experimental rock , acid rock , proto-prog , experimental pop (while under Barrett), psychedelic pop , and psychedelic rock . O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:  Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype  Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging ... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own ... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance   During the late 1960s, the press labelled their music psychedelic pop, progressive pop and progressive rock ; the band gained a following as a psychedelic pop group  In 1968, Wright commented on Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group  We never saw ourselves that way ... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun ... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted ... the emphasis ... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation  Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: There wasn't anything 'grand' about it  We were laughable  We were useless  We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental' ... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing  Interstellar Overdrive  for hours and hours  Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s   —Alan di Perna, in Guitar World , May 2006  Rolling Stone critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as integral to Pink Floyd's sound, and described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen . Rolling Stone named him the 14th greatest guitarist of all time  In 2006, Gilmour said of his technique:  fingers make a distinctive sound ... aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows . Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis .  In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures  According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on Money,  Time  and  Comfortably Numb  cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog  Brown described the Time solo as a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato  Brown described Gilmour's phrasing as intuitive and perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist  Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... singing sustain ... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold  It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade   Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound  Their second single, See Emily Play premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967  During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator . The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect  In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system   Waters experimented with the VCS 3 synthesiser on Pink Floyd pieces such as  On the Run ,  Welcome to the Machine , and  In the Flesh  . He used a binson echorec 2 delay effect on his bass-guitar track for  One of These Days .  Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut . Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect  The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones  The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears   Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee . In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder 's film More . The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets , the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter  While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni 's film Zabriskie Point , the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month  Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week  Eventually he used only three of their recordings  One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called The Violent Sequence, later became Us and Them, included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon . In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée , for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds . They composed the material in about a week at the Château d'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart   Regarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems  From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London  Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground   To celebrate the launch of the London Free School 's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of the Roundhouse , attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull . In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers , mirrors and stretched condoms . After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation  On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace , London  Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise  In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called  Moonhead .  In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows  In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named Algie  Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour  The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall . The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a 40 feet (12 m) high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience  They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story  They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story  One striking feature of the tour was the performance of Comfortably Numb  While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall  When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him  Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician  A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech   During the Division Bell Tour , an unknown person using the name Publius posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album  White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius  During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word enigma in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage  Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band   Marked by Waters' philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as purveyors of a distinctively dark vision  Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference  Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd  Author George Reisch described Meddle 's psychedelic opus, Echoes, as built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy , and collaboration with others  Despite having been labelled the gloomiest man in rock, author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist , dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics   Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's  Have a Cigar  deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives  The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes Pink is the name of one of the band members  According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce, a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience   Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd  Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War . Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours  Their film score, Obscured by Clouds , dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing  Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here : The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling  Waters commented: it's about none of us really being there ... should have been called Wish We Were Here .  O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music  Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall , with the lyrics to Comfortably Numb: I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye  I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone  Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, Jugband Blues: I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here   Author Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the powerful sounds and suggestive themes of Dark Side with The Wall 's portrayal of artistic alienation  He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm . Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: If you didn't care what happened to me  And I didn't care for you, then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each  The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia , the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines   The album's characters include the Dogs, representing fervent capitalists, the Pigs, symbolising political corruption, and the Sheep, who represent the exploited  Croskery described the Sheep as being in a state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity, a false consciousness . The Dog, in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation  Waters used Mary Whitehouse as an example of a Pig; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society  At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: You know that I care what happens to you  And I know that you care for me too  However, he also acknowledges that the Pigs are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a Dog who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them   —Waters, quoted in Harris, 2005  O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of Dark Side of the Moon 's  Brain Damage  with Karl Marx 's theory of self-alienation ; there's someone in my head, but it's not me  The lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's Welcome to the Machine suggest what Marx called the alienation of the thing ; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others  Allusions to the alienation of man's species being can be found in Animals ; the Dog reduced to living instinctively as a non-human  The Dogs become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a necessary and defensible position in a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle wrote Detmer  Alienation from others is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of The Wall .  War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of The Wall , and a recurring theme in the band's music  Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from Corporal Clegg (1968),  Free Four  (1972),  Us and Them  (1973),  When the Tigers Broke Free  and  The Fletcher Memorial Home  from The Final Cut (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled A Requiem for the Postwar Dream . The themes and composition of The Wall express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women   Waters' lyrics to The Dark Side of the Moon dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity  He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition  However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it an exhortation ... to embrace the positive and reject the negative  Reisch described The Wall as less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness  The Wall 's protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making  After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is crazy, over the rainbow  He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: have I been guilty all this time  Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him  He then stands trial for showing feelings of an almost human nature, further exacerbating his alienation of species being  As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault , Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies, contribute to his angst, according to Reisch   Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time  They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37 9 million albums sold in the US since 1993  The Sunday Times Rich List , Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million   In 2004, MSNBC ranked Pink Floyd number 8 on their list of The 10 Best Rock Bands Ever  In the same year, Q named Pink Floyd as the biggest band of all time according to a points system that measured sales of their biggest album, the scale of their biggest headlining show and the total number of weeks spent on the UK album chart  Rolling Stone ranked them number 51 on their list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  VH1 ranked them number 18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  Colin Larkin ranked Pink Floyd number 3 in his list of the 'Top 50 Artists of All Time', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist's albums included in his All Time Top 1000 Albums . In 2008, the head rock and pop critic of The Guardian , Alexis Petridis , wrote that the band occupy a unique place in progressive rock, stating, Thirty years on, prog is still persona non grata Only Pink Floyd—never really a prog band, their penchant for long songs and 'concepts' notwithstanding—are permitted into the 100 best album lists   Pink Floyd have won several awards  In 1981 audio engineer James Guthrie won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Album for The Wall , and Roger Waters won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Original Song Written for a Film in 1983 for Another Brick in the Wall from The Wall film . In 1995, Pink Floyd won the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for  Marooned . In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music; Waters and Mason attended the ceremony and accepted the award  They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010   Pink Floyd have influenced numerous artists  David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and The Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to  Dogs  from Animals . Other bands and artists who cite them as an influence include Queen , Radiohead , Steven Wilson , Marillion , Queensrÿche , Nine Inch Nails , the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins . Pink Floyd were an influence on the neo-progressive rock subgenre which emerged in the 1980s  The English rock band Mostly Autumn fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd in their sound   Pink Floyd were admirers of the Monty Python comedy group, and helped finance their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail . In 2016, Pink Floyd became the second band (after the Beatles ) to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail . In May 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of Pink Floyd's first single, an audio-visual exhibition, Their Mortal Remains , opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London  The exhibition featured analysis of cover art, conceptual props from the stage shows, and photographs from Mason's personal archive  It was extended for two weeks beyond its planned closing date of 1 October   Books  Documentaries     Powderfinger were an Australian rock band formed in Brisbane in 1989  From 1992 until their break-up in 2010, the line-up consisted of vocalist Bernard Fanning , guitarists Darren Middleton and Ian Haug , bass guitarist John Collins and drummer Jon Coghill . The group's third studio album Internationalist peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart in September 1998  They followed with four more number-one studio albums in a row: Odyssey Number Five (September 2000), Vulture Street (July 2003), Dream Days at the Hotel Existence (June 2007) and Golden Rule (November 2009). Their Top Ten hit singles are  My Happiness  (2000),  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind  (2003) and  Lost and Running  (2007). Powderfinger earned a total of eighteen ARIA Awards , making them the second-most awarded band behind Silverchair . Ten Powderfinger albums and DVDs certified multiple- platinum , with Odyssey Number Five – their most successful album – achieving eightfold platinum certification for shipment of over 560,000 units   After the release of their first DVD, These Days: Live in Concert (September 2004), and the compilation album Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 (November 2004), the group announced a hiatus in 2005  The June 2007 announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with Silverchair, Across the Great Divide tour , followed the release of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . Powderfinger were also involved in various philanthropic causes  In 2005, they performed at a WaveAid concert in Sydney , to help raise funds for areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake . Another performance at the Sydney Opera House in October 2007 raised funds for breast cancer victims and their families  One aim of their Across the Great Divide Tour was to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia , and awareness of the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children  In April 2010 Powderfinger announced that they would be breaking up after their Sunsets Farewell Tour , declaring it would be their last ever as they had musically said everything they wanted to say  On 13 November 2010, they played their last concert, signifying their disbandment  In November the following year, rock music journalist Dino Scatena and Powderfinger published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band   On 23 May 2020, the band reformed for a one-off livestreamed charity performance, One Night Lonely .  Powderfinger were formed in 1989 by Steven Bishop (ex-the Eternal) on drums, John Collins (the Eternal) on bass guitar, and Ian Haug (the Vibrants, the Fossils) on guitar and vocals  The Eternal, the Vibrants, and the Fossils were other Brisbane-based outfits  All three members of Powderfinger were students at Brisbane Grammar School – a private school in Spring Hill – and they started as a cover band playing pub rock classics by the Rolling Stones , the Doors , Led Zeppelin , Steppenwolf , Rodriguez , and Neil Young . The band's name comes from Young's song of the same name . Despite their popularity in Brisbane, when playing a heavy metal gig in Newcastle, New South Wales , in 1990, Powderfinger were booed off stage   After completing secondary education, Collins and Haug attended the University of Queensland , where the latter met Bernard Fanning in an economics class – and learned that Fanning had similar interests in music and could sing  Fanning took over the role of lead vocals from Haug and also provided guitar and harmonica  Late in 1990, Jon Coghill – another university student with Fanning and Haug – replaced Bishop on drums, which was described as a mutual leaving  Bishop later worked in London-based bands based in London, UK , before returning to Brisbane where he was a member of Moonjuice and then the Haymakers  Powderfinger's final line-up change was in 1992 with the addition of Darren Middleton (The Pirates) on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals  Powderfinger initially performed cover versions of other artists' songs, but gradually developed by writing and performing their own material   In August 1992, the group self-funded a seven-track self-titled extended play , also known as the Blue EP , on their own Finger label, and the album was distributed by MDS  It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane  The EP has an early version of  Save Your Skin , co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton, and Fanning; it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a single from their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears . Their second EP, Transfusion , was issued in September 1993 and distributed by Polydor Records . At that time, Simon McKenzie of Time Off noted they were hoping the major label will put a bit of weight behind the disc, but it's not as though they've signed a record deal or anything  McKenzie felt the EP showed they were wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, but is it also a reaction against the sixties tags they've been stuck with . The five tracks include Reap What You Sow, which reached the No  1 spot on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart , replacing Nirvana 's  Heart-Shaped Box . The group recorded their first music video , for Reap What You Sow; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos  After the EP's success, the group were signed by Polydor   In January 1994, Powderfinger performed on the Big Day Out Tour (see 1994 line-up ). On 18 July that year, they released their debut studio album, Parables for Wooden Ears , under Polydor  According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane , it featured complex, meticulously crafted rock but was somewhat ponderous and sombre, which did little to fulfil the promise displayed on Transfusion . The album was produced by Tony Cohen ( Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds , The Cruel Sea ), and Fanning later described it as the band's dark dark days  It received limited radio coverage  Supporting the album's release, the band toured heavily, appearing at the Livid and Homebake music festivals  Powderfinger supported United States visitors Pantera on that group's Driven Downunder Tour '94  Another Australian support act on the tour was Newcastle-formed band Silverchair . Three singles were released from Powderfinger's debut album –  Tail ,  Grave Concern , and  Save Your Skin  – but none appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top 50  Following the album's release and lukewarm reception, in April 1995, the band recorded at Melbourne's Metropolis Studio with Lachlan Magoo Goold ( Regurgitator ) and in July released a five-track EP, Mr Kneebone .  The band's second studio album, Double Allergic , was issued on 2 September 1996; it peaked at No  4 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified triple  platinum by ARIA for shipment of 210,000 units by 2007  It was co-produced by Tim Whitten and the group  McFarlane felt this album was more self-assured and textured consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene, alongside the likes of You Am I , Spiderbait , Silverchair, Regurgitator and Tumbleweed  was full of accessible, spirited rock  Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll noted  revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves  Powderfinger's reason to be is to create songs strong enough for the band and audience to play and hear months or years down the line  Four singles were released from the album –  Pick You Up ,  D.A.F. ,  Living Type , and  Take Me In . Take Me In was released as a video single featuring several other music videos by the group  FasterLouder, a music review web site, recalled that when Double Allergic was released in 1996, it showed the band were here for the long haul to become arguably one of the best of the decade  In 1997 the album was issued in Canada and the group toured North America to promote it   On 7 September 1998, Powderfinger released their third studio album, Internationalist , which peaked at No  1 and spent 101 weeks in the Top 50 of the ARIA Albums Chart; it was produced by Nick DiDia ( Rage Against the Machine , Pearl Jam ). AllMusic 's Jonathan Lewis had mixed feelings about the album  He was enchanted by its lead single,  The Day You Come , however the rest of the album didn't measure up except for some fine tracks in Don't Wanna Be Left Out and Already Gone  Nevertheless, by 2007 the album had shipped over 350,000 copies and was certified five times platinum domestically, and had reached European audiences  Internationalist was the first Powderfinger album to win any ARIA Music Awards . At the 1999 ceremony it won Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Kevin Wilkins), and The Day You Come won Single of the Year   Passenger , another single from Internationalist , was nominated for three additional categories in the following year . The band was both praised and criticised for their political views on Internationalist . In a November 1998 interview with Benedict Watts of Juice Magazine , Haug said that political messages in The Day You Come were not something they were just preaching about, but rather were something they saw as a responsibility   Powderfinger's fourth studio album, Odyssey Number Five , was released on 4 September 2000, and also peaked at No  1. Entertainment Weekly ' s Marc Weingarten provided a positive review and found the group prove that there's still terrain left to be explored guitar rock ... melancholy is the default mode ... can be as prim as Travis or as mock-grandiose as Oasis . However, Allmusic's Dean Carlson was more negative, seeing the album as little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American grunge . Odyssey Number Five is Powderfinger's most commercially successful album, shipping 560,000 copies and certified eight times platinum by 2004  It also appeared on the New Zealand Albums Chart at No  15  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 , the group won Album of the Year, Highest Selling Album, Best Rock Album, Best Cover Art (by Wilkins), and Best Group   Two of Odyssey Number Five ' s tracks featured on film soundtracks:  These Days , written for Two Hands (1999), and  My Kind of Scene  in Mission: Impossible 2 (2000). Singles from the album are My Kind of Scene,  My Happiness ,  Like a Dog , and the double A-side  The Metre / Waiting for the Sun . My Happiness, which peaked at No  4 in Australia and No  7 in New Zealand, is the group's highest-charting single in both countries  At the ARIA Awards ceremony, My Happiness won Single of the Year, and other songs were nominated in various categories  Their tracks received votes from national radio station Triple J 's listeners on annual Hottest 100 lists: These Days, Already Gone,  Good-Day Ray , and Passenger were ranked in 1999 , and My Happiness and My Kind of Scene in 2000 . In 2009, These Days was voted at No  21 and My Happiness at No  27 in the Hottest 100 of all time, placing them as second- and fourth-highest Australian tracks after the Hilltop Hoods '  The Nosebleed Section  and Hunters &amp; Collectors '  Throw Your Arms Around Me , respectively   Powderfinger's Vulture Street was released on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No  1 in Australia, while in New Zealand it reached No  17  Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for the location of the band's first recording room in West End , Brisbane  The Sydney Morning Herald ' s music critic Bernard Zuel approved of a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album with a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect; he felt it had Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut album  Simon Evans of musicOMH described the group as having opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs  Middleton explained that the band's aim was to get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things we grew up loving, which was Bowie , Zeppelin , Kiss ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s  We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it's a very old-school-sounding record  It's all the old amps, we used old guitars and recorded to tape , of course  It's fairly organic in that sense  Vulture Street won four ARIA Awards in 2003 : Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design). Singles issued from the album are:  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind ,  Since You've Been Gone ,  Love Your Way , and  Sunsets . Tracks were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004 .  In September 2004 the group issued their first live album, These Days: Live in Concert , initially as a CD , and followed in October with a two-disc DVD . One single,  Stumblin' , which had appeared on Vulture Street , was issued as a live version  In late October they released a compilation album, Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 , which included many of their singles from the first four albums as well as non-singles Thrilloilogy and Belter, and a re-release of These Days  These Days, although never officially released as a single, was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll of 1999  The album also included two new songs:  Bless My Soul  and Process This, although only Bless My Soul was released as a single  Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger appeared at the WaveAid fundraising concert in January 2005 in Sydney, to raise funds for aid organisations working in the disaster-affected areas  Fanning, as a member of The Wrights , sang lead vocals on  Evie, part 2  at the concert  The Wrights released a studio version in March as a single with some of the proceeds going to tsunami relief efforts   After the WaveAid concert, from early 2005, Powderfinger had a period of hiatus  During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the personal front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife  Middleton's side project, Drag , had issued an EP, Gas Food Lodging , in 2002  Zombos Reviews found the EP was full of well-written jangly pop, and has some rather nice ballads  Their debut album, The Way Out , recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July, was a tad disappointing ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads  Everything's tastefully arranged, and there's always nice melodies and harmonies  Collins and Haug formed The Predators with Powderfinger's former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals  The group released a six-track EP, Pick Up the Pace , in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia   In October 2005 Fanning issued his debut solo album, Tea &amp; Sympathy , which reached No  1 in Australia and No  11 in New Zealand  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 , Fanning won in four categories including Album of the Year for Tea &amp; Sympathy and Best Video for its lead single,  Wish You Well . Wish You Well was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll in 2005  At the end of 2006, Fanning toured in support of the album's release in the United Kingdom and North America; at its conclusion, Powderfinger resumed from their hiatus  Fanning compared his solo work to Powderfinger recordings, saying, when a problem came up in the studio, especially guitar-wise, I've always had Darren and Ian to call on  They could usually come up with something good  But I played all the guitar on it, and my abilities are fairly limited and that Powderfinger is my real job and I'm looking forward to doing it again   Powderfinger started recording their sixth studio album, Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , in January 2007; it was released on 2 June  Debuting at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart – their fourth to do so consecutively – it broke the Australian digital sales record with over 3,000 copies sold online  In general, reviewers did not rate it as highly as its predecessor Vulture Street , with Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun HiT describing it as No radical reinvention, no huge change in direction ... In a word: consistent  Zuel described it as Powderfinger's first dull album but the band as the biggest rock band in the country   Lost and Running , their first single for three years, had been issued in May, and reached No  5. A second single,  I Don't Remember , appeared in August  One song from the album,  Black Tears , was amended following concerns that it could prejudice a trial over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  Fanning stated that an alternative version would be on the album as a result of the concerns  On 18 August that year, Powderfinger performed a concert in Karratha as part of Triple J's AWOL Series  The band was supported by The Grates and Muph N Plutonic, and various local acts  While in Karratha, Fanning and Coghill visited Gumala Mirnuwarni, a local school in Roebourne that encourages children to stay in school   In June 2007 Powderfinger and Silverchair announced the nine-week Across the Great Divide tour to promote reconciliation with Indigenous Australians . From August to October that year the two groups toured all state capital cities as well as fourteen Australian regional centres, and included four performances in New Zealand  They performed 34 concerts in 26 towns across Australia, with an estimated total of 220,000 people in attendance  On 1 December, a triple-DVD set was released with the same title as the tour , with the Melbourne performances for both bands and backstage footage from the tour  The schedule consisted of three main parts, beginning with a supporting artist performing one set, followed by Silverchair and then Powderfinger playing the final set  The two bands united on stage during only three performances throughout the tour, including Daniel Johns (Silverchair) and Fanning sharing lead vocals on a cover version of The Who 's  Substitute  at one show in Sydney and two in Melbourne   Dream Days at the Hotel Existence was the recipient of the ARIA Award for Best Cover Art in 2007 . It was also nominated for Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Group, while Lost and Running received nominations for Single of the Year and Best Video  Powderfinger failed to win any of these awards, with tour mates Silverchair's Young Modern and  Straight Lines  obtaining all five  On 28 October at the ceremony, Powderfinger performed Lost and Running  The third single from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence ,  Nobody Sees , was released in December 2007  On 27 September 2008, Powderfinger performed (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind and AC/DC 's  Long Way to the Top  at the AFL Grand Final . Their song Drifting Further Away featured on Grey's Anatomy ' s fifth season in episode 13,  Stairway to Heaven , which aired on 21 January 2009   From mid-June 2009 Powderfinger worked with DiDia producing their seventh studio album, Golden Rule , which was issued on 13 November  The album peaked at No  1 on the ARIA albums chart – becoming their fifth studio album in a row to do so  The album's lead single,  All of the Dreamers , was released in September  Burn Your Name, the second single, followed in December  That same month the band performed at the 2009 Homebake festival after a 10-year absence  In late January they toured on the 2010 Big Day Out  The third single from the album, Sail the Widest Stretch, appeared in April   Also in April 2010, Powderfinger announced that after 21 years the group would disband following their Sunsets Farewell Tour in September and October that year:  With the completion of our last album, Golden Rule , we feel that we have said all that we want to say as a musical group  We firmly believe that it is our most complete and satisfying album and can't think of a better way to farewell our fans than with music that we all believe in and also with, hopefully, our best tour to date   Coghill told Australian Times that the final tour is going to be great fun, but it's also going to be sad  He confirmed that he had no plans to start a new band or for a solo project  Instead he intended to finish his degree,  nce I'm done with that, I might put the feelers out and see what's happening  I don't think I'd be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just to have a chance to keep playing  I'm just not keen to be off touring the world anymore  Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was These Days  On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, I'm on Your Side, as a fundraiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of major flooding in Queensland from December the previous year into January  The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause  On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, Footprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 2001–2011 , containing two new tracks  There was also a 2-disc release, Fingerprints &amp; Footprints – The Ultimate Collection , combining both Fingerprints and Footprints in one set  Also in November, Dino Scatena, together with the band, published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band . Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in October of the previous year, during the Sunsets Farewell Tour   Former Powderfinger member Bernard Fanning worked on his second solo album Departures during late 2012 in Los Angeles, with Joe Chiccarelli producing  It was released in June the following year and peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart  Middleton had relocated to Melbourne and worked with Red Door Sounds' Paul Annison – producer of Children Collide 's album Monument (April 2012). In December that year Middleton revealed that I’m halfway through a new record  Middleton's album, Translations , was released independently in November 2013  Around the same time Coghill was working as a journalist on the Gold Coast, while Collins was developing business projects in Queensland   In January 2013 Haug produced the second album, Sins of a Li'l Later Kiss , by Brisbane-based folk duo Cole and Van Dijk  He then joined the Church , replacing Marty Willson-Piper , and featured on their 2014 album Further/Deeper .  On the 23 May 2020, Powderfinger reformed for a one off, live-streamed YouTube charity performance titled, One Night Lonely with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue and Support Act  On 25 May, an EP of the performance was released   On 31 August 2020, Powderfinger confirmed the release of a compilation album of unreleased songs titled Unreleased (1998–2010) due on the 27th November 2020, which was preceded by the single Day by Day, released on 18 September   On 13 November 2020, Powderfinger released the second single preceding the release of the album Unreleased (1998-2010) Daybreak   Powderfinger's musical style includes hard rock and alternative music and, according to McFarlane, the band made its mark with an earthy, blues-based sound that combined soaring, 1970s-influenced riff-rock with 1990s studio technology  With the added textures of folk, country and a soulful groove, the band was able to head in any direction  Nimmervoll acclaimed them as one of Australia's most popular radio-friendly rock bands which produced music the rest of Australia embraced  McFarlane was partially disappointed with their debut 1994 album Parables for Wooden Ears compared to their earlier EP Transfusion . Their 1996 album, Double Allergic , was more self-assured and textured and consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene  It revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves according to Nimmervoll   In a November 2007 interview with Paul Cashmere of the website Undercover, Middleton stated that a couple of songs they had initially written for Vulture Street were just too Odyssey Number Five based, and that the first track, Rockin' Rocks, was probably the start of where we were heading with the album  Cashmere stated that the album was the toughest heard Powderfinger sound  Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger's more recent albums, and described Vulture Street as a rawer, louder album in comparison to Odyssey Number Five ; it highlighted Fanning's talent as a lyricist and he stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut  Zuel also stated that there is a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, and described On My Mind as having  AC/DC meatiness, and Love Your Way as acoustic tumbling into weaving Zeppelin lines  In his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , Zuel described it as  high-gloss and muscular framework, and stated that that was what American radio considers serious rock   Compared with the relatively lean, agile sound they've perfected up to now, this is Powderfinger as the footballer who in the off-season spends his time in the gym and emerges buff and beefy  The problem is he has bulk but has traded in his nimbleness   Clayton Bolger of AllMusic stated in his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence that Powderfinger largely revisit the sound of their Internationalist album, leaving behind much of the glam and swagger of 2003's Vulture Street . He commented on Fanning's commanding and distinctive vocals, the twin-guitar attack of Middleton and Haug, Collins' innovative basslines, and the powerhouse drum work of Coghill  Nimmervoll described Golden Rule as Powderfinger back to its essence  They’d experimented with the sound, tried different things with the songwriting process and recorded in America with different producers  was recorded at home, the band reunited with American Nick DiDia, who had previously worked with the band during the classic era, producing Internationalist , Odyssey Number 5 and Vulture Street . They also wrote the songs as a team, with Bernard responsible for the bulk of the lyrics  The album was recorded in the same spirit, as close to the live sound as a studio album could be   Powderfinger were active in supporting causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances  In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children's Hospital on 24 November  They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts Custard and You Am I to also appear on the steps of the Sydney Opera House . The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled Farewell to the World , was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people  In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005  The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area  The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected   The song  Black Tears  from the album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence originally had the lyric An island watchhouse bed, a black man's lying dead, which sparked fears that it might prejudice the trial of the former Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  The band claimed that the song's lyrics primarily dealt with the climbing of Uluru by tourists despite requests from the Indigenous people of the area to respect their sacred sites and not climb  The original version of the song was retracted from the album, and replaced with an alternative version with the criticised material removed  The legal team for Hurley, who was charged with manslaughter over the death of Mulrunji in 2004, had referred the song to the Attorney-General of Queensland , Kerry Shine , in their attempt at altering the track  One of Hurley's lawyers, Glen Cranny, stated that the content and proposed timing of the song's release raises some serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley's trial  Powderfinger's band manager, Paul Piticco , stated that Fanning had confirmed that a line in the song was related to the case  However, he added that the lyric in question could refer to a watchhouse in The Bahamas or something   In June 2007, Powderfinger and Silverchair announced their combined Across the Great Divide Tour, which promoted Reconciliation Australia , a foundation helping to improve the welfare of the Indigenous people of Australia, and to show both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation  Reconciliation Australia increased the awareness of the 17-year difference in life expectancy between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous children of Australia  In October that year, during Breast Cancer Awareness Month , Powderfinger performed another concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House  This concert was for invitees only – breast cancer patients, survivors, and their families were eligible to attend  Powderfinger performed alongside Silverchair, Missy Higgins , and other artists to an audience of 700  The concert was filmed and later broadcast as a MAX Session on Foxtel channel MAX on 3 November   For the Sunsets Farewell Tour in September 2010, the band promoted another Indigenous cause, the Yalari organisation  The organisation provides Indigenous children with opportunities to get a proper education  In January 2011, following the Queensland flood disaster , reported that Powderfinger would not reform for a benefit concert, but the band instead donated a never-before released track, I'm on Your Side, to help raise money for the victims   Throughout their recording career, Powderfinger consisted of five members: Bernard Fanning as lead vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist, and harmonicist; John Collins as bass guitarist; Ian Haug, originally the lead vocalist until Fanning joined, played lead guitars; Darren Middleton on co-lead guitars, keyboards, backing vocals, and occasional lead vocals; Jon Coghill as drummer and percussionist  Their lineup remained stable from 1992 until their disbandment in November 2010  Steven Bishop had been the group's original drummer, but had left to focus on his studies  The band refers to one another by nicknames, including Collins as JC and Coghill as Cogsy   Powderfinger have collaborated with various artists throughout their career: Pianist Benmont Tench played on Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . For touring or session work, auxiliary musicians used include Alex Pertout on percussion, Duane Billings on percussion, and Lachlan Doley on keyboards  For their second album, Double Allergic , the group enlisted Tim Whitten as producer  The group approached American expatriate Nick DiDia as their producer for Internationalist , and recorded with him at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne  DiDia also produced the two albums which followed  In 2007 Rob Schnapf , producer for Beck , was asked to produce Dream Days at the Hotel Existence in Los Angeles  DiDia returned for Golden Rule . Powderfinger's first music video, for the song Reap What You Sow in 1993, was directed by David Barker, an award-winning director  Film companies who directed other videos for the group include Fifty Fifty Films and Head Pictures   Powderfinger was highly successful in the Australian recording industry, being a recipient of the industry's flagship awards, the ARIA Music Awards, 18 times from 47 nominations – the third-highest behind Silverchair's 21 wins from 49 nominations and John Farnham 's 20 wins from 56 nominations  Powderfinger's most successful year was 2001 , when they won six awards from eight nominations for Odyssey Number Five and its related singles  These Days and My Happiness were ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 lists in 1999 and 2000 respectively, and 21 other Powderfinger tracks have ranked on lists in other years   In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Powderfinger were announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for their role as Influential Artists   General  Specific     Joseph Maurice Ravel ( French:  ; 7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor  He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy , although both composers rejected the term  In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer   Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire ; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal  After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of modernism, baroque , neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz . He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development  He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known   A slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries  Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music  Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration  Some of his piano music, such as Gaspard de la nuit (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chloé (1912) require skilful balance in performance   Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public  From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision   Ravel was born in the Basque town of Ciboure , France, near Biarritz , 18 kilometres (11 mi) from the Spanish border  His father, Pierre-Joseph Ravel , was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in Versoix near the Franco-Swiss border  His mother, Marie, née Delouart, was Basque but had grown up in Madrid  In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status – Marie was illegitimate and barely literate – but the marriage was a happy one  Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early internal combustion engine and a notorious circus machine, the Whirlwind of Death, an automotive loop-the-loop that was a major attraction until a fatal accident at Barnum and Bailey's Circus in 1903   Both Ravel's parents were Roman Catholics ; Marie was also something of a free-thinker , a trait inherited by her elder son  He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born  The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born  (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession ) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music  Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him  The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods   Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general  In later life, Ravel recalled, Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music  My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age  There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father   When he was seven, Ravel started piano lessons with Henry Ghys, a friend of Emmanuel Chabrier ; five years later, in 1887, he began studying harmony , counterpoint and composition with Charles-René, a pupil of Léo Delibes . Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy  Charles-René found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort  Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by Schumann , variations on a theme by Grieg and a single movement of a piano sonata  They survive only in fragmentary form   In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist Ricardo Viñes , who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music  The two shared an appreciation of Wagner , Russian music, and the writings of Poe , Baudelaire and Mallarmé . At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov . This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy , as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan , also heard during the Exposition   Émile Decombes took over as Ravel's piano teacher in 1889; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance  Aged fourteen, he took part in a concert at the Salle Érard along with other pupils of Decombes, including Reynaldo Hahn and Alfred Cortot .  With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the Conservatoire de Paris . In November 1889, playing music by Chopin , he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eugène Anthiome  Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student  Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer  The musicologist Arbie Orenstein writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period of immense growth   ... from adolescence to maturity   In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot , for piano, and Émile Pessard , for harmony  He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from Bériot but, in the words of the musicologist Barbara L. Kelly , he was only teachable on his own terms  His later teacher Gabriel Fauré understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s  Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes  His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: Sérénade grotesque , for piano, and Ballade de la Reine morte d'aimer, a mélodie setting a poem by Roland de Marès (both 1893).  Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Viñes and Cortot were  It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer  From this point he concentrated on composition  His works from the period include the songs Un grand sommeil noir and D'Anne jouant de l'espinette to words by Paul Verlaine and Clément Marot , and the piano pieces Menuet antique and Habanera (for four hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the Rapsodie espagnole . At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie , who was earning a living as a café pianist  Ravel was one of the first musicians – Debussy was another – who recognised Satie's originality and talent  Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them of inestimable value   In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with Fauré, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with André Gedalge . Both these teachers, particularly Fauré, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer  As Ravel's course progressed, Fauré reported a distinct gain in maturity   ... engaging wealth of imagination  Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, Théodore Dubois , who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook  Consequently, according to a fellow student, Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi , he was a marked man, against whom all weapons were good  He wrote some substantial works while studying with Fauré, including the overture Shéhérazade and a violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900  As a former student he was allowed to attend Fauré's classes as a non-participating auditeur until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903   In 1899 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: Pavane pour une infante défunte ( Pavane for a dead princess). It was originally a solo piano work, commissioned by the Princesse de Polignac . In 1897 he conducted the first performance of the Shéhérazade overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics  One described the piece as a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School and called Ravel a mediocrely gifted debutant   ... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years, if he works hard  Another critic, Pierre Lalo , thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven . Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic   From the start of his career, Ravel appeared calmly indifferent to blame or praise  Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine  The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own, perfectionist and severely self-critical  At twenty years of age he was, in the words of the biographer Burnett James, self-possessed, a little aloof, intellectually biased, given to mild banter  He dressed like a dandy and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour  Orenstein comments that, short in stature, light in frame and bony in features, Ravel had the appearance of a well-dressed jockey, whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect  During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century, Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day; from his mid-thirties he was clean-shaven   Around 1900 Ravel and a number of innovative young artists, poets, critics and musicians joined together in an informal group; they came to be known as Les Apaches (The Hooligans), a name coined by Viñes to represent their status as artistic outcasts  They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War, and members stimulated one another with intellectual argument and performances of their works  The membership of the group was fluid, and at various times included Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla as well as their French friends   Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy  Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued for more than ten years  In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique . It divided musical opinion  Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece  The Apaches were loud in their support  The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them   Debussy was widely held to be an impressionist composer – a label he intensely disliked  Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre  Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not  Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship  Ravel wrote that Debussy's genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition  For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy   ... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of symbolism . During the first years of the new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece Jeux d'eau (1901), the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works  Nichols calls the quartet at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence   The two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons  Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other  Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom  Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people  The public tension led to personal estrangement  Ravel said, It's probably better for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons  Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift  In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer Emma Bardac . Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante Misia Edwards and the opera star Lucienne Bréval , contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband    During the first years of the new century Ravel made five attempts to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome , past winners of which included Berlioz , Gounod , Bizet , Massenet and Debussy  In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition  In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy , the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies  In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a furore . He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable  The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu , was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received  L'affaire Ravel became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire   Among those taking a close interest in the controversy was Alfred Edwards , owner and editor of Le Matin , for which Lalo wrote  Edwards was married to Ravel's friend Misia; the couple took Ravel on a seven-week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905, the first time he had travelled abroad   By the latter part of the 1900s Ravel had established a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra  He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed  There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters  The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestrated 1910), Une barque sur l'océan (1906, from the 1905 piano suite Miroirs ), the Habanera section of Rapsodie espagnole (1907–08), Ma mère l'Oye (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911, orchestrated 1912), Alborada del gracioso (from Miroirs , orchestrated 1918) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).  Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them  Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent  Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters  He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound  When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity  The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams , who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08  Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner   ... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto   Vaughan Williams's recollections throw some light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation  Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels, Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women  By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange . Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual  Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry ; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery   Ravel's first concert outside France was in 1909  As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Société des Concerts Français, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation   The Société Nationale de Musique , founded in 1871 to promote the music of rising French composers, had been dominated since the mid-1880s by a conservative faction led by Vincent d'Indy . Ravel, together with several other former pupils of Fauré, set up a new, modernist organisation, the Société Musicale Indépendente, with Fauré as its president  The new society's inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Fauré's song cycle La chanson d'Ève , Debussy's piano suite D'un cahier d'esquisses , Zoltán Kodály 's Six pièces pour piano and the original piano duet version of Ravel's Ma mère l'Oye . The performers included Fauré, Florent Schmitt , Ernest Bloch , Pierre Monteux and, in the Debussy work, Ravel  Kelly considers it a sign of Ravel's new influence that the society featured Satie's music in a concert in January 1911   The first of Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy L'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911  The work had been completed in 1907, but the manager of the Opéra-Comique, Albert Carré , repeatedly deferred its presentation  He was concerned that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the Opéra-Comique's audience  The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular   In 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered  The first, to the orchestrated and expanded version of Ma mère l'Oye , opened at the Théâtre des Arts in January  The reviews were excellent: the Mercure de France called the score absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature  The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the Queen's Hall , London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year  The Times praised the enchantment of the work   ... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing  New York audiences heard the work in the same year  Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was Adélaïde ou le langage des fleurs , danced to the score of Valses nobles et sentimentales , which opened at the Châtelet in April  Daphnis et Chloé opened at the same theatre in June  This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete   Daphnis et Chloé was commissioned in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes . Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine , and designer, Léon Bakst . Fokine had a reputation for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music  This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music  There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work  It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London  The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere   Ravel composed little during 1913  He collaborated with Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky 's unfinished opera Khovanshchina , and his own works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier . In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of The Rite of Spring . Stravinsky later said that Ravel was the only person who immediately understood the music  Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande .  When Germany invaded France in 1914 Ravel tried to join the French Air Force . He considered his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator, but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint  While waiting to be enlisted, Ravel composed Trois Chansons , his only work for a cappella choir, setting his own texts in the tradition of French 16th-century chansons  He dedicated the three songs to people who might help him to enlist  After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist, Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915, when he was forty  Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend's courage: at his age and with his name he could have had an easier place, or done nothing  Some of Ravel's duties put him in mortal danger, driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment  At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother's failing health  His own health also deteriorated; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems, underwent a bowel operation following amoebic dysentery in September 1916, and had frostbite in his feet the following winter   During the war, the Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française was formed by Saint-Saëns, Dubois, d'Indy and others, campaigning for a ban on the performance of contemporary German music  Ravel declined to join, telling the committee of the league in 1916, It would be dangerous for French composers to ignore systematically the productions of their foreign colleagues, and thus form themselves into a sort of national coterie: our musical art, which is so rich at the present time, would soon degenerate, becoming isolated in banal formulas  The league responded by banning Ravel's music from its concerts   Ravel's mother died in January 1917, and he fell into a horrible despair, compounding the distress he felt at the suffering endured by the people of his country during the war  He composed few works in the war years  The Piano Trio was almost complete when the conflict began, and the most substantial of his wartime works is Le tombeau de Couperin , composed between 1914 and 1917  The suite celebrates the tradition of François Couperin , the 18th-century French composer; each movement is dedicated to a friend of Ravel's who died in the war   After the war, those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina  As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, Ravel's emotional equilibrium, so hard won in the previous decade, had been seriously compromised  His output, never large, became smaller  Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era  Fauré wrote to him, I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly  It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor  Ravel was offered the Legion of Honour in 1920, and although he declined the decoration, he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie's protégés Les Six as an establishment figure  Satie had turned against him, and commented, Ravel refuses the Légion d'honneur, but all his music accepts it  Despite this attack, Ravel continued to admire Satie's early music, and always acknowledged the older man's influence on his own development  Ravel took a benign view of Les Six, promoting their music, and defending it against journalistic attacks  He regarded their reaction against his works as natural, and preferable to their copying his style  Through the Société Musicale Indépendente, he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries  The Société presented concerts of recent works by American composers including Aaron Copland , Virgil Thomson and George Antheil and by Vaughan Williams and his English colleagues Arnold Bax and Cyril Scott .  Orenstein and Zank both comment that, although Ravel's post-war output was small, averaging only one composition a year, it included some of his finest works  In 1920 he completed La valse , in response to a commission from Diaghilev  He had worked on it intermittently for some years, planning a concert piece, a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz, mingled with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, fatal whirling  It was rejected by Diaghilev, who said, It's a masterpiece, but it's not a ballet  It's the portrait of a ballet  Ravel heard Diaghilev's verdict without protest or argument, left, and had no further dealings with him  Nichols comments that Ravel had the satisfaction of seeing the ballet staged twice by other managements before Diaghilev died  A ballet danced to the orchestral version of Le tombeau de Couperin was given at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in November 1920, and the premiere of La valse followed in December  The following year Daphnis et Chloé and L'heure espagnole were successfully revived at the Paris Opéra   In the post-war era there was a reaction against the large-scale music of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss . Stravinsky, whose Rite of Spring was written for a huge orchestra, began to work on a much smaller scale  His 1923 ballet score Les noces is composed for voices and twenty-one instruments  Ravel did not like the work (his opinion caused a cooling in Stravinsky's friendship with him) but he was in sympathy with the fashion for dépouillement – the stripping away of pre-war extravagance to reveal the essentials  Many of his works from the 1920s are noticeably sparer in texture than earlier pieces  Other influences on him in this period were jazz and atonality . Jazz was popular in Parisian cafés, and French composers such as Darius Milhaud incorporated elements of it in their work  Ravel commented that he preferred jazz to grand opera , and its influence is heard in his later music  Arnold Schönberg 's abandonment of conventional tonality also had echoes in some of Ravel's music such as the Chansons madécasses (1926), which Ravel doubted he could have written without the example of Pierrot Lunaire . His other major works from the 1920s include the orchestral arrangement of Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition (1922), the opera L'enfant et les sortilèges to a libretto by Colette (1926), Tzigane (1924) and the Violin Sonata (1927).  Finding city life fatiguing, Ravel moved to the countryside  In May 1921 he took up residence at Le Belvédère, a small house on the fringe of Montfort-l'Amaury , 50 kilometres (31 mi) west of Paris, in the Yvelines département . Looked after by a devoted housekeeper, Mme Revelot, he lived there for the rest of his life  At Le Belvédère Ravel composed and gardened, when not performing in Paris or abroad  His touring schedule increased considerably in the 1920s, with concerts in Britain, Sweden, Denmark, the US, Canada, Spain, Austria and Italy   Arbie Orenstein  After two months of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting  His fee was a guaranteed minimum of $ 10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes  He appeared with most of the leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities  Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary  At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York, the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat  Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed, You know, this doesn't happen to me in Paris  Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel's international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe's house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon . Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity  He commented that the critics' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, when they called him the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion   The last composition Ravel completed in the 1920s, Boléro , became his most famous  He was commissioned to provide a score for Ida Rubinstein 's ballet company, and having been unable to secure the rights to orchestrate Albéniz 's Iberia , he decided on an experiment in a very special and limited direction   ... a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of orchestral tissue without music  Ravel continued that the work was one long, very gradual crescendo  There are no contrasts, and there is practically no invention except the plan and the manner of the execution  The themes are altogether impersonal  He was astonished, and not wholly pleased, that it became a mass success  When one elderly member of the audience at the Opéra shouted Rubbish  at the premiere, he remarked, That old lady got the message  The work was popularised by the conductor Arturo Toscanini , and has been recorded several hundred times  Ravel commented to Arthur Honegger , one of Les Six, I've written only one masterpiece – Boléro . Unfortunately there's no music in it   At the beginning of the 1930s Ravel was working on two piano concertos  He completed the Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand first  It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein , who had lost his right arm during the war  Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project: In a work of this kind, it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands  Ravel, not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand, demonstrated it with both hands  Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece, but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work  In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim, and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year  The critic Henry Prunières wrote, From the opening measures, we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us   The Piano Concerto in G major was completed a year later  After the premiere in January 1932 there was high praise for the soloist, Marguerite Long, and for Ravel's score, though not for his conducting  Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting; they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted   Igor Stravinsky  In October 1932 Ravel suffered a blow to the head in a taxi accident  The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition  As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia . Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score  Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée . The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription  Ravel composed no more after this  The exact nature of his illness is unknown  Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour , and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia , Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease . Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months  Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head   In 1937 Ravel began to suffer pain from his condition, and was examined by Clovis Vincent , a well-known Paris neurosurgeon  Vincent advised surgical treatment  He thought a tumour unlikely, and expected to find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing  Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view  After the operation there seemed to be an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma  He died on 28 December, at the age of 62   On 30 December 1937 Ravel was interred next to his parents in a granite tomb at Levallois-Perret cemetery , in north-west Paris  He was an atheist and there was no religious ceremony   Marcel Marnat 's catalogue of Ravel's complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned  Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries, it is nevertheless inflated by Ravel's frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra  The performable body of works numbers about sixty; slightly more than half are instrumental  Ravel's music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera and song cycles  He wrote no symphonies or church works   Ravel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy  Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert , Liszt and Chopin  He considered himself in many ways a classicist , often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary , to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies  The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata   Ravel to Vaughan Williams  Ravel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is an implied melodic outline in all vital music  His themes are frequently modal instead of using the familiar major or minor scales  As a result, there are few leading notes in his output  Chords of the ninth and eleventh and unresolved appoggiaturas , such as those in the Valses nobles et sentimentales , are characteristic of Ravel's harmonic language   Dance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the bolero and pavane, but also the minuet , forlane , rigaudon , waltz , czardas , habanera and passacaglia . National and regional consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to Hebraic , Greek , Hungarian and gypsy themes  He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired – Borodin , Chabrier, Fauré and Haydn , interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style  Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion, with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude   Ravel completed two operas, and worked on three others  The unrealised three were Olympia , La cloche engloutie and Jeanne d'Arc . Olympia was to be based on Hoffmann 's The Sandman ; he made sketches for it in 1898–99, but did not progress far  La cloche engloutie after Hauptmann 's The Sunken Bell occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912, Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works, except for a Symphonie horlogère which he incorporated into the opening of L'heure espagnole . The third unrealised project was an operatic version of Joseph Delteil 's 1925 novel about Joan of Arc . It was to be a large-scale, full-length work for the Paris Opéra, but Ravel's final illness prevented him from writing it   Ravel's first completed opera was L'heure espagnole (premiered in 1911), described as a comédie musicale  It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career  Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects  Edward Burlingame Hill found Ravel's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action, and commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage  Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity  The critic David Murray writes that the score glows with the famous Ravel tendresse .  The second opera, also in one act, is L'enfant et les sortilèges (1926), a fantaisie lyrique to a libretto by Colette  She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto  It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than L'heure espagnole , and the jazz elements and bitonality of much of the work upset many Parisian opera-goers  Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work  The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout   Although one-act operas are generally staged less often than full-length ones, Ravel's are produced regularly in France and abroad   A substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal  His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome  His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as a static, recitative-like vocal style, prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility  By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in Histoires naturelles . The same technique is highlighted in Trois poèmes de Mallarmé (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided  In the cycles Shéhérazade and Chansons madécasses , Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment   Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as Cinq mélodies populaires grecques , Deux mélodies hébraïques and Chants populaires . Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue , Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine  For three songs dating from 1914–15, he wrote his own texts   Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices  Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade , to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score   During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous  He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use  The critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote, In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a pp tam-tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another   For all Ravel's orchestral mastery, only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra: Rapsodie espagnole , La valse and the two concertos  All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in Daphnis et Chloé , or as a reworking of piano pieces, Alborada del gracioso and Une barque sur l'ocean , ( Miroirs ), Valses nobles et sentimentales, Ma mère l'Oye , Tzigane (originally for violin and piano) and Le tombeau de Couperin  In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms  Occasionally, as in the Alborada del gracioso , critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original   In some of his scores from the 1920s, including Daphnis et Chloé , Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six to eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility  His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points  In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures  The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of Mozart and Saint-Saëns, alongside use of jazz-like themes  The critics Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor comment that in the slow movement, one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented, the composer can truly be said to join hands with Mozart  The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, Boléro (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm   Ravel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann, Chabrier, Debussy and Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition . Orchestral versions of the last by Mikhail Tushmalov , Sir Henry Wood and Leo Funtek predated Ravel's 1922 version, and many more have been made since, but Ravel's remains the best known  Kelly remarks on its dazzling array of instrumental colour, and a contemporary reviewer commented on how, in dealing with another composer's music, Ravel had produced an orchestral sound wholly unlike his own   Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch from the striking simplicity of Ma mère l'Oye to the transcendental virtuosity of Gaspard de la nuit . Ravel's earliest major work for piano, Jeux d'eau (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later  When writing for solo piano, Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity  The authors of The Record Guide consider that works such as Gaspard de la Nuit and Miroirs have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself   Most of Ravel's piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges  Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing  It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in Alborada del gracioso   ... and the two outer movements of Gaspard de la nuit . Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale  This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in Gaspard de la nuit , Le gibet would bore the audience to death  Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing   Ravel's regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works; Menuet sur le nom de Haydn (1909), À la manière de Borodine (1912), À la manière de Chabrier (1913) and Le tombeau de Couperin all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically Ravellian manner  Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions: Listen to Le tombeau de Couperin and the complete ballet music for Ma mère L'Oye in the classic recordings conducted by André Cluytens , and the piano versions never sound quite the same again   Apart from a one-movement sonata for violin and piano dating from 1899, unpublished in the composer's lifetime, Ravel wrote seven chamber works  The earliest is the String Quartet (1902–03), dedicated to Fauré, and showing the influence of Debussy's quartet of ten years earlier  Like the Debussy, it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers, with more succinct melodies, fluently interchanged, in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour  The Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet (1905) was composed very quickly by Ravel's standards  It is an ethereal piece in the vein of the Pavane pour une infante défunte . Ravel also worked at unusual speed on the Piano Trio (1914) to complete it before joining the French Army  It contains Basque, Baroque and far Eastern influences, and shows Ravel's growing technical skill, dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello, blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own, in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson   Ravel's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920–22), the Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Fauré for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of Tzigane for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923–27). The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel's teacher, and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist Jelly d'Arányi . The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody  His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work  Ravel said that the violin and piano are essentially incompatible instruments, and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility  Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor consider the post-war sonatas rather laboured and unsatisfactory, and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel's pre-war chamber works   Ravel's interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on piano roll between 1914 and 1928, although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by Robert Casadesus , a better pianist  Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc  In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of Jeux d'eau played by Mark Hambourg , and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the Pavane pour une infante défunte and Ondine , and movements from the String Quartet, Le tombeau de Couperin and Ma mère l'Oye . Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public, and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works, some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor  A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as Conducted by the composer, although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton  Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a Boléro in 1930, and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist   Ravel declined not only the Légion d'honneur, but all state honours from France, refusing to let his name go forward for election to the Institut de France . He accepted foreign awards, including honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921, the Belgian Ordre de Léopold in 1926, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1928   After Ravel's death, his brother and legatee, Edouard, turned the composer's house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it  As of 2018 the maison-musée de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours   In his later years, Edouard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind  After his death in 1960, the estate passed through several hands  Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were  The British newspaper The Guardian reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair      Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns ( French:  ; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era . His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (Organ) Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886).  Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten  After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri , Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine , the official church of the French Empire . After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas   As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann , Liszt and Wagner , although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition  He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers  This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six , he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death   Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years  It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré , among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel . Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius   Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin  Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris , and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice , always considered himself a true Parisian  Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption (tuberculosis) on the first anniversary of his marriage  The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil , 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris   When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson  Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano  His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty , a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner . Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training  Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young  The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart  The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel , in a programme that included Mozart 's Piano Concerto in B ♭ ( K 450), and Beethoven 's Third Piano Concerto . Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher Alexandre Pierre François Boëly . From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of Bach , which was then little known in France   As a schoolboy Saint-Saëns was outstanding in many subjects  In addition to his musical prowess, he distinguished himself in the study of French literature, Latin and Greek, divinity, and mathematics  His interests included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life   In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire , France's foremost music academy  The director, Daniel Auber , had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative  Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist  His organ professor was François Benoist , whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam , César Franck , Charles Alkan , Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet . In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies  His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy , whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet   Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo . He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome , in 1852 but was unsuccessful  Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen , who made little mark during the rest of his career  In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile , for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize  The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).  On leaving the Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns accepted the post of organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville . The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year there were more than two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income  The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot , had been badly damaged in the aftermath of the French Revolution and imperfectly restored  The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered  With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E ♭ (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire . The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile   Among the musicians who were quick to spot Saint-Saëns's talent were the composers Gioachino Rossini , Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt , and the influential singer Pauline Viardot , who all encouraged him in his career  In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of La Madeleine , the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world   Although in later life he had a reputation for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner . Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions  He commented, I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character  They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me  But I am not, I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion   In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France  Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies  He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner  His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré , recalled in old age:  After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known  ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I had for him, throughout my life   Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager ). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals , with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school   In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome  Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer  He was once more unsuccessful  Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote:  We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy  We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing  I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity  But the other man, who is still a student, has that inner fire, inspiration, he feels, he can do things that can't be learnt and the rest he'll learn more or less  So I voted for him, sighing at the thought of the unhappiness that this failure must cause Saint-Saëns  But, whatever else, one must be honest   According to the musical scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his well-known bon mot about Saint-Saëns, He knows everything, but lacks inexperience (Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience). The winner, Victor Sieg , had a career no more notable than that of the 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency  The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation  He himself wrote, Art is intended to create beauty and character  Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it  In fact, it is very much better off when it does  The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul  The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius, and Bad music well written   While teaching at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of his energy into composing and performing, but after he left in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with vigour  In 1867 his cantata Les noces de Prométhée beat more than a hundred other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi . In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his Second Piano Concerto . Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s   In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine , professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music  Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out  Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war  During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871  With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals  Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society  The Société Nationale de Musique , with its motto, Ars Gallica , had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc , Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members   As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems , Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first poème symphonique was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872  In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged  La princesse jaune (The Yellow Princess), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique , Paris in June  It ran for five performances   Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother  In 1875, he surprised many by marrying  The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils  The marriage was not a success  In the words of the biographer Sabina Teller Ratner, Saint-Saëns's mother disapproved, and her son was difficult to live with  Saint-Saëns and his wife moved to the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince , in the Latin Quarter ; his mother moved with them  The couple had two sons, both of whom died in infancy  In 1878, the elder, André, aged two, fell from a window of the flat and was killed; the younger, Jean-François, died of pneumonia six weeks later, aged six months  Saint-Saëns and Marie-Laure continued to live together for three years, but he blamed her for André's accident; the double blow of their loss effectively destroyed the marriage   For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music  Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere  In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged  His four-act drame lyricque, Le timbre d'argent (The Silver Bell), to Jules Barbier 's and Michel Carré 's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production  The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances   The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition  Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died  He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities  After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all  He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted   In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila , his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire  Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation  Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892   Saint-Saëns was a keen traveller  From the 1870s until the end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries  His professional engagements took him most often to Germany and England; for holidays, and to avoid Parisian winters which affected his weak chest, he favoured Algiers and various places in Egypt   Saint-Saëns was elected to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878  In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday  On 28 July he disappeared from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say that he would not be returning  They never saw each other again  Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five  Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman  Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women  After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle  Marie told him, For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here   In the 1880s Saint-Saëns continued to seek success in the opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it was unthinkable that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera  He had two operas staged during the decade, the first being Henry VIII (1883) commissioned by the Paris Opéra  Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Saëns, normally a fluent, even facile composer, worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England  The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer's lifetime  When it was produced at Covent Garden in 1898, The Era commented that though French librettists generally make a pretty hash of British history, this piece was not altogether contemptible as an opera story   The open-mindedness of the Société Nationale had hardened by the mid-1880s into a dogmatic adherence to Wagnerian methods favoured by Franck's pupils, led by Vincent d'Indy . They had begun to dominate the organisation and sought to abandon its Ars Gallica ethos of commitment to French works  Bussine and Saint-Saëns found this unacceptable, and resigned in 1886  Having long pressed the merits of Wagner on a sometimes sceptical French public, Saint-Saëns was now becoming worried that the German's music was having an excessive impact on young French composers  His increasing caution towards Wagner developed in later years into stronger hostility, directed as much at Wagner's political nationalism as at his music   By the 1880s Saint-Saëns was an established favourite with audiences in England, where he was widely regarded as the greatest living French composer  In 1886 the Philharmonic Society of London commissioned what became one of his most popular and respected works, the Third (Organ) Symphony . It was premiered in London at a concert in which Saint-Saëns appeared as conductor of the symphony and as soloist in Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto , conducted by Sir Arthur Sullivan . The success of the symphony in London was considerable, but was surpassed by the ecstatic welcome the work received at its Paris premiere early the following year  Later in 1887 Saint-Saëns's drame lyrique Proserpine opened at the Opéra-Comique  It was well received and seemed to be heading for a substantial run when the theatre burnt down within weeks of the premiere and the production was lost   In December 1888 Saint-Saëns's mother died  He felt her loss deeply, and was plunged into depression and insomnia, even contemplating suicide  He left Paris and stayed in Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose   During the 1890s Saint-Saëns spent much time on holiday, travelling overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before  A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell through in 1893  He wrote one opera, the comedy Phryné (1893), and together with Paul Dukas helped to complete Frédégonde (1895) an opera left unfinished by Ernest Guiraud , who died in 1892  Phryné was well received, and prompted calls for more comic operas at the Opéra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring grand opera . His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement fantasia Africa (1891) and his Fifth (Egyptian) Piano Concerto , which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his début at the Salle Pleyel in 1846  Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother's tutelage and his public's long support   Among the concerts that Saint-Saëns undertook during the decade was one at Cambridge in June 1893, when he, Bruch and Tchaikovsky performed at an event presented by Charles Villiers Stanford for the Cambridge University Musical Society , marking the award of honorary degrees to all three visitors  Saint-Saëns greatly enjoyed the visit, and even spoke approvingly of the college chapel services: The demands of English religion are not excessive  The services are very short, and consist chiefly of listening to good music extremely well sung, for the English are excellent choristers  His mutual regard for British choirs continued for the rest of his life, and one of his last large-scale works, the oratorio The Promised Land , was composed for the Three Choirs Festival of 1913   In 1900, after ten years without a permanent home in Paris, Saint-Saëns took a flat in the rue de Courcelles, not far from his old residence in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré  This remained his home for the rest of his life  He continued to travel abroad frequently, but increasingly often to give concerts rather than as a tourist  He revisited London, where he was always a welcome visitor, went to Berlin, where until the First World War, he was greeted with honour, and travelled in Italy, Spain, Monaco and provincial France  In 1906 and 1909 he made highly successful tours of the United States, as a pianist and conductor  In New York on his second visit he premiered his Praise ye the Lord for double choir, orchestra and organ, which he composed for the occasion   Despite his growing reputation as a musical reactionary, Saint-Saëns was, according to Gallois, probably the only French musician who travelled to Munich to hear the premiere of Mahler 's Eighth Symphony in 1910  Nonetheless, by the 20th century Saint-Saëns had lost much of his enthusiasm for modernism in music  Though he strove to conceal it from Fauré, he did not understand or like the latter's opera Pénélope (1913), of which he was the dedicatee  In 1917 Francis Poulenc , at the beginning of his career as a composer, was dismissive when Ravel praised Saint-Saëns as a genius  By this time, various strands of new music were emerging with which Saint-Saëns had little in common  His classical instincts for form put him at odds with what seemed to him the shapelessness and structure of the musical impressionists, led by Debussy  Nor did the theories of Arnold Schönberg 's dodecaphony commend themselves to Saint-Saëns:  There is no longer any question of adding to the old rules new principles which are the natural expression of time and experience, but simply of casting aside all rules and every restraint  Everyone ought to make his own rules  Music is free and unlimited in its liberty of expression  There are no perfect chords, dissonant chords or false chords  All aggregations of notes are legitimate  That is called, and they believe it, the development of taste .  Holding such conservative views, Saint-Saëns was out of sympathy – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty  It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky 's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913  In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane   When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music during the First World War, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with their old teacher  They were privately concerned that their friend was in danger of looking foolish with his excess of patriotism, and his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy's En blanc et noir (1915): We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the cubist pictures  His determination to block Debussy's candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer's supporters  Saint-Saëns's response to the neoclassicism of Les Six was equally uncompromising: of Darius Milhaud 's polytonal symphonic suite Protée (1919) he commented, fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France   Saint-Saëns gave what he intended to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance as a result of the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities  These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German warships   In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut for a large invited audience; it was remarked that his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his personal bearing was admirable for a man of eighty-six  He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do  While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921  His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the cimetière du Montparnasse . Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881   In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Saëns in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians wrote:  Saint-Saëns is a consummate master of composition, and no one possesses a more profound knowledge than he does of the secrets and resources of the art; but the creative faculty does not keep pace with the technical skill of the workman  His incomparable talent for orchestration enables him to give relief to ideas which would otherwise be crude and mediocre in themselves ... his works are on the one hand not frivolous enough to become popular in the widest sense, nor on the other do they take hold of the public by that sincerity and warmth of feeling which is so convincing   Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saëns was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past  In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic D   C   Parker wrote, That Saint-Saëns knows Rameau   ... Bach and Handel , Haydn and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings  His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art   Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Saëns often favoured self-contained melodies  Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, supple and pliable, more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the phrase pattern AABB is characteristic  An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him  Grove observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring  In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar  Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although Grove points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works   The authors of the 1955 The Record Guide , Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor write that Saint-Saëns's brilliant musicianship was instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the fact that there are other forms of music besides opera  In the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary , Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Saëns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c.1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia  Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable  The Urbs Roma Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and thick and heavy in its effect  Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of fugal writing  The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ  It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune  The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Saëns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885). The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring motif treated in a Lisztian style of thematic transformation .  Saint-Saëns's four symphonic poems follow the model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the vulgar blatancy to which the earlier composer was prone  The most popular of the four is Danse macabre (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight  Saint-Saëns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation, but in this piece he featured the xylophone prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers  Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871) was composed soon after the horrors of the Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies  Rees rates Phaëton (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer's professed indifference to melody, and inspired in its depiction of the mythical hero and his fate  A critic at the time of the premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece  The last of the four symphonic poems, La jeunesse d'Hercule (Hercules's Youth, 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful  In the judgment of the critic Roger Nichols these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel   Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, Javot (1896), the score for the film L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), and incidental music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916  Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier .  Saint-Saëns was the first major French composer to write piano concertos  His First , in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the Second , in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works  The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary sonata form first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn cadenza . The scherzo second movement and presto finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist Zygmunt Stojowski commented that the work begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach  The Third Piano Concerto , in E ♭ (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines  The Fourth , in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second  It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos  According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns the Beethoven of France (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor  The work is known as the Egyptian concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in Luxor , and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing   The First Cello Concerto , in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section  It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by Pablo Casals and later players  The Second , in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections  It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saint-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult  There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's Second , in C major  The First, in A, was also completed in 1858  It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour  The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime  The Third , in B minor, written for Pablo de Sarasate , is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity  It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso , in A minor, Op  28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863  It changes from a wistful and tense opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, After a multi-stopped cadenza ... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major   Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde , Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques . During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work  The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior  In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics  Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune , which Harding describes as like Sullivan with a light French touch   Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s  In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content   ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable  Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models  From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs , which, like Massenet, he used sparingly  Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less variety of tempo within individual numbers  In a survey of recorded opera Alan Blyth writes that Saint-Saëns certainly learned much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of Aida , and Wagner, but from these excellent models he forged his own style   From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies , writing more than 140  He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder . Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (Persian Songs, 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (The Red Ash Tree, 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo ; others included Alphonse de Lamartine , Pierre Corneille , Amable Tastu , and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet  He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable  Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including Le lever du soleil sur le Nil (Sunrise over the Nile, 1898) and Hymne à la paix (Hymn to Peace, 1919), are for voice and orchestra  His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy .  Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios  Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein . He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence , of oratorio  He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra  In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre  In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Saëns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it   Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark  Nichols excepts the Étude en forme de valse (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique  Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed the French Beethoven, and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E ♭ (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas  He is not known even to have contemplated writing one  There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns's works for the piano are single short pieces  In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as Souvenir d'Italie (1887), Les cloches du soir (Evening bells, 1889) and Souvenir d'Ismaïlia (1895).  Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo  Some of them were written for use in church services – Offertoire (1853), Bénédiction nuptiale (1859), Communion (1859) and others  After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former   Saint-Saëns wrote more than forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years  One of the first of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, confident piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other cantabile . The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms  At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of baroque composers including Rameau and Lully .  Sabina Teller Ratner, 2005  In Ratner's view, the most important of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment  The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by Grove's Dictionary as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions  The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards  The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier  It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment  Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance  The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo   The woodwind sonatas are among the composer's last works  Ratner writes of them, The spare, evocative, classical lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement  Gallois comments that the Oboe Sonata begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of tarantella . For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata is the most important of the three: he calls it a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism amounting to a summary of the rest  The work contrasts a doleful threnody  in the slow movement with the finale, which pirouettes in 4/4 time, in a style reminiscent of the 18th century  The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata a model of transparency, vitality and lightness, containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation   The composer's most famous work, The Carnival of the Animals (1887), although far from a typical chamber piece, is written for eleven players, and is considered by Grove's Dictionary to be part of Saint-Saëns's chamber output  Grove rates it as his most brilliant comic work, parodying Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Rossini, his own Danse macabre and several popular tunes  He forbade performances of it during his lifetime, concerned that its frivolity would damage his reputation as a serious composer   Saint-Saëns was a pioneer in recorded music  In June 1904 The Gramophone Company of London sent its producer Fred Gaisberg to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the mezzo-soprano Meyriane Héglon in arias from Ascanio and Samson et Dalila , and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra). Saint-Saëns made more recordings for the company in 1919   In the early days of the LP record , Saint-Saëns's works were patchily represented on disc  The Record Guide (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of Danse Macabre , The Carnival of the Animals , the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works  In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD  The 2008 Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Saëns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets  Also listed are an early Mass, collections of organ music, and choral songs  A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Saëns's mélodies was released in 1997   With the exception of Samson et Dalila the operas have been sparsely represented on disc  A recording of Henry VIII was issued on CD and DVD in 1992  Hélène was released on CD in 2008  There are several recordings of Samson et Dalilah , under conductors including Sir Colin Davis , Georges Prêtre , Daniel Barenboim and Myung-Whun Chung .  Saint-Saëns was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1867 and promoted to Officier in 1884, and Grand Croix in 1913  Foreign honours included the British Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1902, and honorary doctorates from the universities of Cambridge (1893) and Oxford (1907).  In its obituary notice, The Times commented:  The death of M. Saint-Saëns not only deprives France of one of her most distinguished composers; it removes from the world the last representative of the great movements in music which were typical of the 19th century  He had maintained so vigorous a vitality and kept in such close touch with present-day activities that, though it had become customary to speak of him as the doyen of French composers, it was easy to forget the place he actually took in musical chronology  He was only two years younger than Brahms, was five years older than Tchaikovsky, six years older than Dvořák , and seven years older than Sullivan  He held a position in his own country's music certain aspects of which may be fitly compared with each of those masters in their own spheres   In a short poem, Mea culpa, published in 1890 Saint-Saëns accused himself of lack of decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were not for him  An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day  The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form  The critic Henry Colles , wrote, a few days after the composer's death:  In his desire to maintain the perfect equilibrium we find the limitation of Saint-Saëns's appeal to the ordinary musical mind  Saint-Saëns rarely, if ever, takes any risks; he never, to use the slang of the moment, goes off the deep end  All his greatest contemporaries did  Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and even Franck, were ready to sacrifice everything for the end each wanted to reach, to drown in the attempt to get there if necessary  Saint-Saëns, in preserving his equilibrium, allows his hearers to preserve theirs   Grove concludes its article on Saint-Saëns with the observation that although his works are remarkably consistent, it cannot be said that he evolved a distinctive musical style  Rather, he defended the French tradition that threatened to be engulfed by Wagnerian influences and created the environment that nourished his successors   Since the composer's death writers sympathetic to his music have expressed regret that he is known by the musical public for only a handful of his scores such as The Carnival of the Animals , the Second Piano Concerto, the Third Violin Concerto, the Organ Symphony, Samson et Dalila , Danse macabre and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso  Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio , the ballet Javotte , the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces  In 2004, the cellist Steven Isserlis said, Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself ... there are Masses, all of which are interesting  I've played all his cello music and there isn't one bad piece  His works are rewarding in every way  And he's an endlessly fascinating figure      The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975  Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years, they are regarded as one of the most groundbreaking acts in the history of popular music . They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians  Their fashion and hairstyles have been credited as a significant influence on punk image , and they are often associated with anarchism within music   The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten , guitarist Steve Jones , drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock . Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977  Under the management of Malcolm McLaren , the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain  Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single  God Save the Queen , attacking Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they precipitated the punk rock movement  It was banned not only by the BBC but also by nearly every independent radio station, making it the most heavily censored record in British history   The band's only album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols (1977)—a UK number one album—is a staple record of punk rock  In January 1978, at the end of their over-hyped and turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten announced the band's break-up  Over the next few months, the three remaining band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex Pistols' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle . Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen . Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock briefly reunited for a concert tour in 1996   The Sex Pistols have been recognised as an influence on various genres, including grunge , indie , thrash metal and rap . In 2004, Rolling Stone placed them No  58 on its list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols—the four original members plus Vicious—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum a piss stain   The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar  According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments they had stolen  Early line-ups of The Strand—sometimes known as The Swankers—also included Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass  The band members regularly hung out at two clothing shops on the King's Road in Chelsea , London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor's Acme Attractions (where Don Letts worked as manager) and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood 's Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die  McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme  It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the 50's rocker look associated with Marlon Brando . As John Lydon later observed, Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto  The shop became a focal point of the punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious , Marco Pirroni , Gene October , and Mark Stewart , among many others  Jordan , the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look   In early 1974, Jones asked McLaren to manage The Strand  Effectively agreeing, McLaren paid for their first formal rehearsal space  Glen Matlock , an art student who occasionally worked at 'Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die', was recruited as the band's regular bassist  In November, McLaren temporarily relocated to New York City  Before his departure, McLaren and Westwood had conceived a new identity for their shop: renamed Sex , it changed its focus from retro couture to S&amp;M -inspired anti-fashion , with a billing as Specialists in rubberwear, glamourwear &amp; stagewear  After informally managing and promoting the New York Dolls for a few months, McLaren returned to London in May 1975  Inspired by the punk scene that was emerging in Lower Manhattan —in particular by the radical visual style and attitude of Richard Hell , then with Television —McLaren began taking a greater interest in The Strand members   The group had been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes , and had performed publicly for the first time  Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale was kicked out of the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties  According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones &amp; His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group  When those plans fell through, McLaren, Rhodes and the band began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties  As described by Matlock, Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so what we used to do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer  For instance, former singer with boy band Slik and future Ultravox front man Midge Ure claims to have been approached by McLaren, but to have refused the offer  With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation   In August 1975, Bernard Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old King's Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes  Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook  According to Jones, He came in with green hair  I thought he had a really interesting face  I liked his look  He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins  John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart  When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper 's  I'm Eighteen  on the shop jukebox  Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks  During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe  These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett  The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate  Waters commented: Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd   While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio  Thorgerson recalled that he sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there  He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him  Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience  Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth . Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US   In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space  In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals , in their newly finished 24-track studio  The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell 's political fable Animal Farm . The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep  Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station , over which they superimposed an image of a pig   The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis  Although Gilmour was largely responsible for Dogs, which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part  Pigs on the Wing . Wright commented: It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there  Mason recalled: Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately  Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album  Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals ; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering  Animals was the first Pink Floyd album with no writing credit for Wright, who said: This was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me   Released in January 1977, Animals peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three  NME described the album as one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music, and Melody Maker ' s Karl Dallas called it  uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific   Pink Floyd performed much of Animals during their  In the Flesh  tour  It was their first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band  Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance  On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to quit  At the Montreal Olympic Stadium , a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them  The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish   In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album  The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former  Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album  Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II . This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett  At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person   During the recording of The Wall , the band became dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution and fired him  Gilmour said that Wright was dismissed as he hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little  According to Mason, Wright would sit in on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'. Waters said the band agreed that Wright would either have to have a long battle or agree to leave quietly after the album was finished; Wright accepted the ultimatum and left   The Wall was supported by Pink Floyd's first single since Money,  Another Brick in the Wall (Part II) , which topped the charts in the US and the UK  The Wall was released on 30 November 1979 and topped the Billboard chart in the US for 15 weeks, reaching number three in the UK  It is number three on the RIAA 's list of the all-time Top 100 albums, with 23 million certified units sold in the US  The cover, with a stark brick wall and band name, was the first Pink Floyd album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis   Gerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the Wall tour  He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline, including the Mother, the Ex-wife and the Schoolmaster  Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances  Relationships within the band reached an all-time low; their four Winnebagos parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre  Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band  Wright returned as a paid musician, making him the only band member to profit from the tour, which lost about $600,000 (US$1,687,335 in 2019 dollars ).  The Wall was adapted into a film, Pink Floyd – The Wall . The film was conceived as a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved impractical to film  Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach  The animated sequences remained, but scenes were acted by actors with no dialogue  Waters was screentested, but quickly discarded and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the role of Pink  Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall ' s storyline as bollocks  Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed  Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd – The Wall premièred in the UK in July 1982   In 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks , originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall  With the onset of the Falklands War , Waters changed direction and began writing new material  He saw Margaret Thatcher 's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father  Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall . Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire  Michael Kamen , a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall , mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright  The tension within the band grew  Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure  After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions   Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album  With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure  Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself  Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US  Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album  Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused  Gilmour later commented: I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut . Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece  Loder viewed The Final Cut as essentially a Roger Waters solo album   Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face , in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters  He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd  Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity , which went almost unnoticed upon its release  Mason released his second solo album, Profiles , in August 1985   Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking , Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite  He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments  O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager  He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs  Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations  Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd  Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him  He went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd a spent force creatively   When Waters' lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name  Gilmour responded with a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist  The sides reached an out-of-court agreement, finalised on Gilmour's houseboat the Astoria on Christmas Eve 1987  In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members   In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason . There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions  Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence would make us stronger legally and musically, and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of $11,000   Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria , moored along the River Thames . The group found it difficult to work without Waters' creative direction; to write lyrics, Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough , eventually choosing Anthony Moore . Wright and Mason were out of practice; Gilmour said they had been destroyed by Roger, and their contributions were minimal   A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987  Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut , designed the album cover  To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle . The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US  Waters commented: I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate  Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: Roger's criticisms are fair  It's not a band album at all  Q magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album   Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name  Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral  Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice  Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them  As Pink Floyd toured North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances  Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig . Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design  The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall .  For several years Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event  In January 1993, they began working on a new album, The Division Bell , returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material  After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs  Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about 25 ideas   Contractually, Wright was not a member of the band, and said, It came close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album  However, he earned five co-writing credits, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here . Another songwriter credited on the album was Gilmour's future wife, Polly Samson . She helped him write several tracks, including  High Hopes , a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, pulled the whole album together, according to Ezrin  They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the album's orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned  Writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork  Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island ; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger  Eager to avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse , Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring  The Division Bell reached number 1 in the UK and the US, and spent 51 weeks on the UK chart   Pink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California , before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour  They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety  The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994  Mason published a memoir, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd , in 2004   On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24 years, at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park , London  The reunion was arranged by Live 8 organiser Bob Geldof ; after Gilmour declined the offer, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters  About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed  In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event   They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios  The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of the event  At the beginning of their performance of Wish You Were Here, Waters told the audience:  quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd  At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage  Waters called him back, and the band shared a group hug  Images of the hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity   Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136 million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only  However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen: The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in  It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that  It's just ... I've been there, I've done it  In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica , which declared: Patience for fans in mourning  The news is official  Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased  Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: It's over ... I've had enough  I'm 60 years old ... it is much more comfortable to work on my own  Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite   Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60  His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended  Wright said: The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death  Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire  Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to music  On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert Madcap's Last Laugh at the Barbican Centre in London  Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed the Barrett compositions  Bike  and Arnold Layne, and Waters performed a solo version of his song Flickering Flame   Wright died of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65  His former bandmates paid tributes to his life and work; Gilmour said: In the welter of arguments about who or what was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten  He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound  A week after Wright's death, Gilmour performed Remember a Day from A Saucerful of Secrets , written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute to him on BBC Two's Later .. with Jools Holland . Keyboardist Keith Emerson released a statement praising Wright as the backbone of Pink Floyd   On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation  The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, with an audience of approximately 200  In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour performed Comfortably Numb at Waters' performance of The Wall at the London O2 Arena on 12 May 2011, singing the choruses and playing the two guitar solos  Mason also joined, playing tambourine for  Outside the Wall  with Gilmour on mandolin   On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd ...   , reissuing the back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including Experience and Immersion multi-disc multi-format editions  The albums were remastered by James Guthrie , co-producer of The Wall . In November 2015, Pink Floyd released a limited edition EP, 1965: Their First Recordings , comprising six songs recorded prior to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn .  In 2012, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album  They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and generally harness studio technology  Waters was not involved  Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound  Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was   The Endless River was released on 7 November 2014, the second Pink Floyd album distributed by Parlophone following the release of the 20th anniversary editions of The Division Bell earlier in 2014  Though it received mixed reviews, it became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK and debuted at number one in several countries  The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997  Gilmour said The Endless River would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end  There was no supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was impossible without Wright  In 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were done and that to reunite without Wright would be wrong  Mason said in 2018 that Gilmour and Waters continued to be at loggerheads   In November 2016, Pink Floyd released a box set, The Early Years 1965–1972 , comprising outtakes, live recordings, remixes, and films from their early career  This was followed in December 2019 by The Later Years , compiling Pink Floyd's work after Waters' departure  The set includes a remixed version of A Momentary Lapse of Reason with more contributions by Wright and Mason, and an expanded reissue of the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder . In 2018, Mason formed a new band, Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets , to perform Pink Floyd's early material  The band includes Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet and longtime Pink Floyd collaborator Guy Pratt . They toured Europe in September 2018 and North America in 2019  Waters joined the band at the New York Beacon Theatre to perform vocals for  Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun .  Considered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, appearing at UFO Club and Middle Earth (club) . According to Rolling Stone : By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock , blues, country , folk , and electronic music . Released in 1968, the song Careful with That Axe, Eugene helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group  Other genres attributed to the band are space rock , experimental rock , acid rock , proto-prog , experimental pop (while under Barrett), psychedelic pop , and psychedelic rock . O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:  Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype  Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging ... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own ... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance   During the late 1960s, the press labelled their music psychedelic pop, progressive pop and progressive rock ; the band gained a following as a psychedelic pop group  In 1968, Wright commented on Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group  We never saw ourselves that way ... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun ... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted ... the emphasis ... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation  Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: There wasn't anything 'grand' about it  We were laughable  We were useless  We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental' ... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing  Interstellar Overdrive  for hours and hours  Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s   —Alan di Perna, in Guitar World , May 2006  Rolling Stone critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as integral to Pink Floyd's sound, and described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen . Rolling Stone named him the 14th greatest guitarist of all time  In 2006, Gilmour said of his technique:  fingers make a distinctive sound ... aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows . Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis .  In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures  According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on Money,  Time  and  Comfortably Numb  cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog  Brown described the Time solo as a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato  Brown described Gilmour's phrasing as intuitive and perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist  Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... singing sustain ... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold  It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade   Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound  Their second single, See Emily Play premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967  During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator . The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect  In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system   Waters experimented with the VCS 3 synthesiser on Pink Floyd pieces such as  On the Run ,  Welcome to the Machine , and  In the Flesh  . He used a binson echorec 2 delay effect on his bass-guitar track for  One of These Days .  Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut . Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect  The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones  The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears   Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee . In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder 's film More . The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets , the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter  While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni 's film Zabriskie Point , the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month  Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week  Eventually he used only three of their recordings  One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called The Violent Sequence, later became Us and Them, included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon . In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée , for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds . They composed the material in about a week at the Château d'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart   Regarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems  From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London  Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground   To celebrate the launch of the London Free School 's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of the Roundhouse , attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull . In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers , mirrors and stretched condoms . After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation  On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace , London  Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise  In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called  Moonhead .  In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows  In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named Algie  Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour  The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall . The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a 40 feet (12 m) high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience  They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story  They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story  One striking feature of the tour was the performance of Comfortably Numb  While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall  When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him  Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician  A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech   During the Division Bell Tour , an unknown person using the name Publius posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album  White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius  During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word enigma in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage  Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band   Marked by Waters' philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as purveyors of a distinctively dark vision  Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference  Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd  Author George Reisch described Meddle 's psychedelic opus, Echoes, as built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy , and collaboration with others  Despite having been labelled the gloomiest man in rock, author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist , dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics   Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's  Have a Cigar  deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives  The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes Pink is the name of one of the band members  According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce, a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience   Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd  Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War . Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours  Their film score, Obscured by Clouds , dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing  Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here : The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling  Waters commented: it's about none of us really being there ... should have been called Wish We Were Here .  O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music  Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall , with the lyrics to Comfortably Numb: I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye  I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone  Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, Jugband Blues: I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here   Author Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the powerful sounds and suggestive themes of Dark Side with The Wall 's portrayal of artistic alienation  He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm . Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: If you didn't care what happened to me  And I didn't care for you, then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each  The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia , the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines   The album's characters include the Dogs, representing fervent capitalists, the Pigs, symbolising political corruption, and the Sheep, who represent the exploited  Croskery described the Sheep as being in a state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity, a false consciousness . The Dog, in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation  Waters used Mary Whitehouse as an example of a Pig; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society  At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: You know that I care what happens to you  And I know that you care for me too  However, he also acknowledges that the Pigs are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a Dog who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them   —Waters, quoted in Harris, 2005  O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of Dark Side of the Moon 's  Brain Damage  with Karl Marx 's theory of self-alienation ; there's someone in my head, but it's not me  The lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's Welcome to the Machine suggest what Marx called the alienation of the thing ; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others  Allusions to the alienation of man's species being can be found in Animals ; the Dog reduced to living instinctively as a non-human  The Dogs become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a necessary and defensible position in a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle wrote Detmer  Alienation from others is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of The Wall .  War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of The Wall , and a recurring theme in the band's music  Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from Corporal Clegg (1968),  Free Four  (1972),  Us and Them  (1973),  When the Tigers Broke Free  and  The Fletcher Memorial Home  from The Final Cut (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled A Requiem for the Postwar Dream . The themes and composition of The Wall express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women   Waters' lyrics to The Dark Side of the Moon dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity  He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition  However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it an exhortation ... to embrace the positive and reject the negative  Reisch described The Wall as less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness  The Wall 's protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making  After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is crazy, over the rainbow  He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: have I been guilty all this time  Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him  He then stands trial for showing feelings of an almost human nature, further exacerbating his alienation of species being  As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault , Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies, contribute to his angst, according to Reisch   Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time  They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37 9 million albums sold in the US since 1993  The Sunday Times Rich List , Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million   In 2004, MSNBC ranked Pink Floyd number 8 on their list of The 10 Best Rock Bands Ever  In the same year, Q named Pink Floyd as the biggest band of all time according to a points system that measured sales of their biggest album, the scale of their biggest headlining show and the total number of weeks spent on the UK album chart  Rolling Stone ranked them number 51 on their list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  VH1 ranked them number 18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  Colin Larkin ranked Pink Floyd number 3 in his list of the 'Top 50 Artists of All Time', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist's albums included in his All Time Top 1000 Albums . In 2008, the head rock and pop critic of The Guardian , Alexis Petridis , wrote that the band occupy a unique place in progressive rock, stating, Thirty years on, prog is still persona non grata Only Pink Floyd—never really a prog band, their penchant for long songs and 'concepts' notwithstanding—are permitted into the 100 best album lists   Pink Floyd have won several awards  In 1981 audio engineer James Guthrie won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Album for The Wall , and Roger Waters won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Original Song Written for a Film in 1983 for Another Brick in the Wall from The Wall film . In 1995, Pink Floyd won the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for  Marooned . In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music; Waters and Mason attended the ceremony and accepted the award  They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010   Pink Floyd have influenced numerous artists  David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and The Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to  Dogs  from Animals . Other bands and artists who cite them as an influence include Queen , Radiohead , Steven Wilson , Marillion , Queensrÿche , Nine Inch Nails , the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins . Pink Floyd were an influence on the neo-progressive rock subgenre which emerged in the 1980s  The English rock band Mostly Autumn fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd in their sound   Pink Floyd were admirers of the Monty Python comedy group, and helped finance their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail . In 2016, Pink Floyd became the second band (after the Beatles ) to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail . In May 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of Pink Floyd's first single, an audio-visual exhibition, Their Mortal Remains , opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London  The exhibition featured analysis of cover art, conceptual props from the stage shows, and photographs from Mason's personal archive  It was extended for two weeks beyond its planned closing date of 1 October   Books  Documentaries     Powderfinger were an Australian rock band formed in Brisbane in 1989  From 1992 until their break-up in 2010, the line-up consisted of vocalist Bernard Fanning , guitarists Darren Middleton and Ian Haug , bass guitarist John Collins and drummer Jon Coghill . The group's third studio album Internationalist peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart in September 1998  They followed with four more number-one studio albums in a row: Odyssey Number Five (September 2000), Vulture Street (July 2003), Dream Days at the Hotel Existence (June 2007) and Golden Rule (November 2009). Their Top Ten hit singles are  My Happiness  (2000),  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind  (2003) and  Lost and Running  (2007). Powderfinger earned a total of eighteen ARIA Awards , making them the second-most awarded band behind Silverchair . Ten Powderfinger albums and DVDs certified multiple- platinum , with Odyssey Number Five – their most successful album – achieving eightfold platinum certification for shipment of over 560,000 units   After the release of their first DVD, These Days: Live in Concert (September 2004), and the compilation album Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 (November 2004), the group announced a hiatus in 2005  The June 2007 announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with Silverchair, Across the Great Divide tour , followed the release of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . Powderfinger were also involved in various philanthropic causes  In 2005, they performed at a WaveAid concert in Sydney , to help raise funds for areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake . Another performance at the Sydney Opera House in October 2007 raised funds for breast cancer victims and their families  One aim of their Across the Great Divide Tour was to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia , and awareness of the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children  In April 2010 Powderfinger announced that they would be breaking up after their Sunsets Farewell Tour , declaring it would be their last ever as they had musically said everything they wanted to say  On 13 November 2010, they played their last concert, signifying their disbandment  In November the following year, rock music journalist Dino Scatena and Powderfinger published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band   On 23 May 2020, the band reformed for a one-off livestreamed charity performance, One Night Lonely .  Powderfinger were formed in 1989 by Steven Bishop (ex-the Eternal) on drums, John Collins (the Eternal) on bass guitar, and Ian Haug (the Vibrants, the Fossils) on guitar and vocals  The Eternal, the Vibrants, and the Fossils were other Brisbane-based outfits  All three members of Powderfinger were students at Brisbane Grammar School – a private school in Spring Hill – and they started as a cover band playing pub rock classics by the Rolling Stones , the Doors , Led Zeppelin , Steppenwolf , Rodriguez , and Neil Young . The band's name comes from Young's song of the same name . Despite their popularity in Brisbane, when playing a heavy metal gig in Newcastle, New South Wales , in 1990, Powderfinger were booed off stage   After completing secondary education, Collins and Haug attended the University of Queensland , where the latter met Bernard Fanning in an economics class – and learned that Fanning had similar interests in music and could sing  Fanning took over the role of lead vocals from Haug and also provided guitar and harmonica  Late in 1990, Jon Coghill – another university student with Fanning and Haug – replaced Bishop on drums, which was described as a mutual leaving  Bishop later worked in London-based bands based in London, UK , before returning to Brisbane where he was a member of Moonjuice and then the Haymakers  Powderfinger's final line-up change was in 1992 with the addition of Darren Middleton (The Pirates) on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals  Powderfinger initially performed cover versions of other artists' songs, but gradually developed by writing and performing their own material   In August 1992, the group self-funded a seven-track self-titled extended play , also known as the Blue EP , on their own Finger label, and the album was distributed by MDS  It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane  The EP has an early version of  Save Your Skin , co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton, and Fanning; it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a single from their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears . Their second EP, Transfusion , was issued in September 1993 and distributed by Polydor Records . At that time, Simon McKenzie of Time Off noted they were hoping the major label will put a bit of weight behind the disc, but it's not as though they've signed a record deal or anything  McKenzie felt the EP showed they were wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, but is it also a reaction against the sixties tags they've been stuck with . The five tracks include Reap What You Sow, which reached the No  1 spot on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart , replacing Nirvana 's  Heart-Shaped Box . The group recorded their first music video , for Reap What You Sow; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos  After the EP's success, the group were signed by Polydor   In January 1994, Powderfinger performed on the Big Day Out Tour (see 1994 line-up ). On 18 July that year, they released their debut studio album, Parables for Wooden Ears , under Polydor  According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane , it featured complex, meticulously crafted rock but was somewhat ponderous and sombre, which did little to fulfil the promise displayed on Transfusion . The album was produced by Tony Cohen ( Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds , The Cruel Sea ), and Fanning later described it as the band's dark dark days  It received limited radio coverage  Supporting the album's release, the band toured heavily, appearing at the Livid and Homebake music festivals  Powderfinger supported United States visitors Pantera on that group's Driven Downunder Tour '94  Another Australian support act on the tour was Newcastle-formed band Silverchair . Three singles were released from Powderfinger's debut album –  Tail ,  Grave Concern , and  Save Your Skin  – but none appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top 50  Following the album's release and lukewarm reception, in April 1995, the band recorded at Melbourne's Metropolis Studio with Lachlan Magoo Goold ( Regurgitator ) and in July released a five-track EP, Mr Kneebone .  The band's second studio album, Double Allergic , was issued on 2 September 1996; it peaked at No  4 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified triple  platinum by ARIA for shipment of 210,000 units by 2007  It was co-produced by Tim Whitten and the group  McFarlane felt this album was more self-assured and textured consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene, alongside the likes of You Am I , Spiderbait , Silverchair, Regurgitator and Tumbleweed  was full of accessible, spirited rock  Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll noted  revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves  Powderfinger's reason to be is to create songs strong enough for the band and audience to play and hear months or years down the line  Four singles were released from the album –  Pick You Up ,  D.A.F. ,  Living Type , and  Take Me In . Take Me In was released as a video single featuring several other music videos by the group  FasterLouder, a music review web site, recalled that when Double Allergic was released in 1996, it showed the band were here for the long haul to become arguably one of the best of the decade  In 1997 the album was issued in Canada and the group toured North America to promote it   On 7 September 1998, Powderfinger released their third studio album, Internationalist , which peaked at No  1 and spent 101 weeks in the Top 50 of the ARIA Albums Chart; it was produced by Nick DiDia ( Rage Against the Machine , Pearl Jam ). AllMusic 's Jonathan Lewis had mixed feelings about the album  He was enchanted by its lead single,  The Day You Come , however the rest of the album didn't measure up except for some fine tracks in Don't Wanna Be Left Out and Already Gone  Nevertheless, by 2007 the album had shipped over 350,000 copies and was certified five times platinum domestically, and had reached European audiences  Internationalist was the first Powderfinger album to win any ARIA Music Awards . At the 1999 ceremony it won Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Kevin Wilkins), and The Day You Come won Single of the Year   Passenger , another single from Internationalist , was nominated for three additional categories in the following year . The band was both praised and criticised for their political views on Internationalist . In a November 1998 interview with Benedict Watts of Juice Magazine , Haug said that political messages in The Day You Come were not something they were just preaching about, but rather were something they saw as a responsibility   Powderfinger's fourth studio album, Odyssey Number Five , was released on 4 September 2000, and also peaked at No  1. Entertainment Weekly ' s Marc Weingarten provided a positive review and found the group prove that there's still terrain left to be explored guitar rock ... melancholy is the default mode ... can be as prim as Travis or as mock-grandiose as Oasis . However, Allmusic's Dean Carlson was more negative, seeing the album as little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American grunge . Odyssey Number Five is Powderfinger's most commercially successful album, shipping 560,000 copies and certified eight times platinum by 2004  It also appeared on the New Zealand Albums Chart at No  15  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 , the group won Album of the Year, Highest Selling Album, Best Rock Album, Best Cover Art (by Wilkins), and Best Group   Two of Odyssey Number Five ' s tracks featured on film soundtracks:  These Days , written for Two Hands (1999), and  My Kind of Scene  in Mission: Impossible 2 (2000). Singles from the album are My Kind of Scene,  My Happiness ,  Like a Dog , and the double A-side  The Metre / Waiting for the Sun . My Happiness, which peaked at No  4 in Australia and No  7 in New Zealand, is the group's highest-charting single in both countries  At the ARIA Awards ceremony, My Happiness won Single of the Year, and other songs were nominated in various categories  Their tracks received votes from national radio station Triple J 's listeners on annual Hottest 100 lists: These Days, Already Gone,  Good-Day Ray , and Passenger were ranked in 1999 , and My Happiness and My Kind of Scene in 2000 . In 2009, These Days was voted at No  21 and My Happiness at No  27 in the Hottest 100 of all time, placing them as second- and fourth-highest Australian tracks after the Hilltop Hoods '  The Nosebleed Section  and Hunters &amp; Collectors '  Throw Your Arms Around Me , respectively   Powderfinger's Vulture Street was released on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No  1 in Australia, while in New Zealand it reached No  17  Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for the location of the band's first recording room in West End , Brisbane  The Sydney Morning Herald ' s music critic Bernard Zuel approved of a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album with a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect; he felt it had Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut album  Simon Evans of musicOMH described the group as having opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs  Middleton explained that the band's aim was to get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things we grew up loving, which was Bowie , Zeppelin , Kiss ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s  We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it's a very old-school-sounding record  It's all the old amps, we used old guitars and recorded to tape , of course  It's fairly organic in that sense  Vulture Street won four ARIA Awards in 2003 : Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design). Singles issued from the album are:  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind ,  Since You've Been Gone ,  Love Your Way , and  Sunsets . Tracks were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004 .  In September 2004 the group issued their first live album, These Days: Live in Concert , initially as a CD , and followed in October with a two-disc DVD . One single,  Stumblin' , which had appeared on Vulture Street , was issued as a live version  In late October they released a compilation album, Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 , which included many of their singles from the first four albums as well as non-singles Thrilloilogy and Belter, and a re-release of These Days  These Days, although never officially released as a single, was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll of 1999  The album also included two new songs:  Bless My Soul  and Process This, although only Bless My Soul was released as a single  Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger appeared at the WaveAid fundraising concert in January 2005 in Sydney, to raise funds for aid organisations working in the disaster-affected areas  Fanning, as a member of The Wrights , sang lead vocals on  Evie, part 2  at the concert  The Wrights released a studio version in March as a single with some of the proceeds going to tsunami relief efforts   After the WaveAid concert, from early 2005, Powderfinger had a period of hiatus  During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the personal front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife  Middleton's side project, Drag , had issued an EP, Gas Food Lodging , in 2002  Zombos Reviews found the EP was full of well-written jangly pop, and has some rather nice ballads  Their debut album, The Way Out , recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July, was a tad disappointing ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads  Everything's tastefully arranged, and there's always nice melodies and harmonies  Collins and Haug formed The Predators with Powderfinger's former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals  The group released a six-track EP, Pick Up the Pace , in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia   In October 2005 Fanning issued his debut solo album, Tea &amp; Sympathy , which reached No  1 in Australia and No  11 in New Zealand  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 , Fanning won in four categories including Album of the Year for Tea &amp; Sympathy and Best Video for its lead single,  Wish You Well . Wish You Well was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll in 2005  At the end of 2006, Fanning toured in support of the album's release in the United Kingdom and North America; at its conclusion, Powderfinger resumed from their hiatus  Fanning compared his solo work to Powderfinger recordings, saying, when a problem came up in the studio, especially guitar-wise, I've always had Darren and Ian to call on  They could usually come up with something good  But I played all the guitar on it, and my abilities are fairly limited and that Powderfinger is my real job and I'm looking forward to doing it again   Powderfinger started recording their sixth studio album, Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , in January 2007; it was released on 2 June  Debuting at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart – their fourth to do so consecutively – it broke the Australian digital sales record with over 3,000 copies sold online  In general, reviewers did not rate it as highly as its predecessor Vulture Street , with Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun HiT describing it as No radical reinvention, no huge change in direction ... In a word: consistent  Zuel described it as Powderfinger's first dull album but the band as the biggest rock band in the country   Lost and Running , their first single for three years, had been issued in May, and reached No  5. A second single,  I Don't Remember , appeared in August  One song from the album,  Black Tears , was amended following concerns that it could prejudice a trial over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  Fanning stated that an alternative version would be on the album as a result of the concerns  On 18 August that year, Powderfinger performed a concert in Karratha as part of Triple J's AWOL Series  The band was supported by The Grates and Muph N Plutonic, and various local acts  While in Karratha, Fanning and Coghill visited Gumala Mirnuwarni, a local school in Roebourne that encourages children to stay in school   In June 2007 Powderfinger and Silverchair announced the nine-week Across the Great Divide tour to promote reconciliation with Indigenous Australians . From August to October that year the two groups toured all state capital cities as well as fourteen Australian regional centres, and included four performances in New Zealand  They performed 34 concerts in 26 towns across Australia, with an estimated total of 220,000 people in attendance  On 1 December, a triple-DVD set was released with the same title as the tour , with the Melbourne performances for both bands and backstage footage from the tour  The schedule consisted of three main parts, beginning with a supporting artist performing one set, followed by Silverchair and then Powderfinger playing the final set  The two bands united on stage during only three performances throughout the tour, including Daniel Johns (Silverchair) and Fanning sharing lead vocals on a cover version of The Who 's  Substitute  at one show in Sydney and two in Melbourne   Dream Days at the Hotel Existence was the recipient of the ARIA Award for Best Cover Art in 2007 . It was also nominated for Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Group, while Lost and Running received nominations for Single of the Year and Best Video  Powderfinger failed to win any of these awards, with tour mates Silverchair's Young Modern and  Straight Lines  obtaining all five  On 28 October at the ceremony, Powderfinger performed Lost and Running  The third single from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence ,  Nobody Sees , was released in December 2007  On 27 September 2008, Powderfinger performed (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind and AC/DC 's  Long Way to the Top  at the AFL Grand Final . Their song Drifting Further Away featured on Grey's Anatomy ' s fifth season in episode 13,  Stairway to Heaven , which aired on 21 January 2009   From mid-June 2009 Powderfinger worked with DiDia producing their seventh studio album, Golden Rule , which was issued on 13 November  The album peaked at No  1 on the ARIA albums chart – becoming their fifth studio album in a row to do so  The album's lead single,  All of the Dreamers , was released in September  Burn Your Name, the second single, followed in December  That same month the band performed at the 2009 Homebake festival after a 10-year absence  In late January they toured on the 2010 Big Day Out  The third single from the album, Sail the Widest Stretch, appeared in April   Also in April 2010, Powderfinger announced that after 21 years the group would disband following their Sunsets Farewell Tour in September and October that year:  With the completion of our last album, Golden Rule , we feel that we have said all that we want to say as a musical group  We firmly believe that it is our most complete and satisfying album and can't think of a better way to farewell our fans than with music that we all believe in and also with, hopefully, our best tour to date   Coghill told Australian Times that the final tour is going to be great fun, but it's also going to be sad  He confirmed that he had no plans to start a new band or for a solo project  Instead he intended to finish his degree,  nce I'm done with that, I might put the feelers out and see what's happening  I don't think I'd be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just to have a chance to keep playing  I'm just not keen to be off touring the world anymore  Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was These Days  On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, I'm on Your Side, as a fundraiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of major flooding in Queensland from December the previous year into January  The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause  On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, Footprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 2001–2011 , containing two new tracks  There was also a 2-disc release, Fingerprints &amp; Footprints – The Ultimate Collection , combining both Fingerprints and Footprints in one set  Also in November, Dino Scatena, together with the band, published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band . Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in October of the previous year, during the Sunsets Farewell Tour   Former Powderfinger member Bernard Fanning worked on his second solo album Departures during late 2012 in Los Angeles, with Joe Chiccarelli producing  It was released in June the following year and peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart  Middleton had relocated to Melbourne and worked with Red Door Sounds' Paul Annison – producer of Children Collide 's album Monument (April 2012). In December that year Middleton revealed that I’m halfway through a new record  Middleton's album, Translations , was released independently in November 2013  Around the same time Coghill was working as a journalist on the Gold Coast, while Collins was developing business projects in Queensland   In January 2013 Haug produced the second album, Sins of a Li'l Later Kiss , by Brisbane-based folk duo Cole and Van Dijk  He then joined the Church , replacing Marty Willson-Piper , and featured on their 2014 album Further/Deeper .  On the 23 May 2020, Powderfinger reformed for a one off, live-streamed YouTube charity performance titled, One Night Lonely with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue and Support Act  On 25 May, an EP of the performance was released   On 31 August 2020, Powderfinger confirmed the release of a compilation album of unreleased songs titled Unreleased (1998–2010) due on the 27th November 2020, which was preceded by the single Day by Day, released on 18 September   On 13 November 2020, Powderfinger released the second single preceding the release of the album Unreleased (1998-2010) Daybreak   Powderfinger's musical style includes hard rock and alternative music and, according to McFarlane, the band made its mark with an earthy, blues-based sound that combined soaring, 1970s-influenced riff-rock with 1990s studio technology  With the added textures of folk, country and a soulful groove, the band was able to head in any direction  Nimmervoll acclaimed them as one of Australia's most popular radio-friendly rock bands which produced music the rest of Australia embraced  McFarlane was partially disappointed with their debut 1994 album Parables for Wooden Ears compared to their earlier EP Transfusion . Their 1996 album, Double Allergic , was more self-assured and textured and consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene  It revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves according to Nimmervoll   In a November 2007 interview with Paul Cashmere of the website Undercover, Middleton stated that a couple of songs they had initially written for Vulture Street were just too Odyssey Number Five based, and that the first track, Rockin' Rocks, was probably the start of where we were heading with the album  Cashmere stated that the album was the toughest heard Powderfinger sound  Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger's more recent albums, and described Vulture Street as a rawer, louder album in comparison to Odyssey Number Five ; it highlighted Fanning's talent as a lyricist and he stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut  Zuel also stated that there is a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, and described On My Mind as having  AC/DC meatiness, and Love Your Way as acoustic tumbling into weaving Zeppelin lines  In his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , Zuel described it as  high-gloss and muscular framework, and stated that that was what American radio considers serious rock   Compared with the relatively lean, agile sound they've perfected up to now, this is Powderfinger as the footballer who in the off-season spends his time in the gym and emerges buff and beefy  The problem is he has bulk but has traded in his nimbleness   Clayton Bolger of AllMusic stated in his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence that Powderfinger largely revisit the sound of their Internationalist album, leaving behind much of the glam and swagger of 2003's Vulture Street . He commented on Fanning's commanding and distinctive vocals, the twin-guitar attack of Middleton and Haug, Collins' innovative basslines, and the powerhouse drum work of Coghill  Nimmervoll described Golden Rule as Powderfinger back to its essence  They’d experimented with the sound, tried different things with the songwriting process and recorded in America with different producers  was recorded at home, the band reunited with American Nick DiDia, who had previously worked with the band during the classic era, producing Internationalist , Odyssey Number 5 and Vulture Street . They also wrote the songs as a team, with Bernard responsible for the bulk of the lyrics  The album was recorded in the same spirit, as close to the live sound as a studio album could be   Powderfinger were active in supporting causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances  In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children's Hospital on 24 November  They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts Custard and You Am I to also appear on the steps of the Sydney Opera House . The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled Farewell to the World , was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people  In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005  The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area  The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected   The song  Black Tears  from the album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence originally had the lyric An island watchhouse bed, a black man's lying dead, which sparked fears that it might prejudice the trial of the former Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  The band claimed that the song's lyrics primarily dealt with the climbing of Uluru by tourists despite requests from the Indigenous people of the area to respect their sacred sites and not climb  The original version of the song was retracted from the album, and replaced with an alternative version with the criticised material removed  The legal team for Hurley, who was charged with manslaughter over the death of Mulrunji in 2004, had referred the song to the Attorney-General of Queensland , Kerry Shine , in their attempt at altering the track  One of Hurley's lawyers, Glen Cranny, stated that the content and proposed timing of the song's release raises some serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley's trial  Powderfinger's band manager, Paul Piticco , stated that Fanning had confirmed that a line in the song was related to the case  However, he added that the lyric in question could refer to a watchhouse in The Bahamas or something   In June 2007, Powderfinger and Silverchair announced their combined Across the Great Divide Tour, which promoted Reconciliation Australia , a foundation helping to improve the welfare of the Indigenous people of Australia, and to show both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation  Reconciliation Australia increased the awareness of the 17-year difference in life expectancy between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous children of Australia  In October that year, during Breast Cancer Awareness Month , Powderfinger performed another concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House  This concert was for invitees only – breast cancer patients, survivors, and their families were eligible to attend  Powderfinger performed alongside Silverchair, Missy Higgins , and other artists to an audience of 700  The concert was filmed and later broadcast as a MAX Session on Foxtel channel MAX on 3 November   For the Sunsets Farewell Tour in September 2010, the band promoted another Indigenous cause, the Yalari organisation  The organisation provides Indigenous children with opportunities to get a proper education  In January 2011, following the Queensland flood disaster , reported that Powderfinger would not reform for a benefit concert, but the band instead donated a never-before released track, I'm on Your Side, to help raise money for the victims   Throughout their recording career, Powderfinger consisted of five members: Bernard Fanning as lead vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist, and harmonicist; John Collins as bass guitarist; Ian Haug, originally the lead vocalist until Fanning joined, played lead guitars; Darren Middleton on co-lead guitars, keyboards, backing vocals, and occasional lead vocals; Jon Coghill as drummer and percussionist  Their lineup remained stable from 1992 until their disbandment in November 2010  Steven Bishop had been the group's original drummer, but had left to focus on his studies  The band refers to one another by nicknames, including Collins as JC and Coghill as Cogsy   Powderfinger have collaborated with various artists throughout their career: Pianist Benmont Tench played on Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . For touring or session work, auxiliary musicians used include Alex Pertout on percussion, Duane Billings on percussion, and Lachlan Doley on keyboards  For their second album, Double Allergic , the group enlisted Tim Whitten as producer  The group approached American expatriate Nick DiDia as their producer for Internationalist , and recorded with him at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne  DiDia also produced the two albums which followed  In 2007 Rob Schnapf , producer for Beck , was asked to produce Dream Days at the Hotel Existence in Los Angeles  DiDia returned for Golden Rule . Powderfinger's first music video, for the song Reap What You Sow in 1993, was directed by David Barker, an award-winning director  Film companies who directed other videos for the group include Fifty Fifty Films and Head Pictures   Powderfinger was highly successful in the Australian recording industry, being a recipient of the industry's flagship awards, the ARIA Music Awards, 18 times from 47 nominations – the third-highest behind Silverchair's 21 wins from 49 nominations and John Farnham 's 20 wins from 56 nominations  Powderfinger's most successful year was 2001 , when they won six awards from eight nominations for Odyssey Number Five and its related singles  These Days and My Happiness were ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 lists in 1999 and 2000 respectively, and 21 other Powderfinger tracks have ranked on lists in other years   In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Powderfinger were announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for their role as Influential Artists   General  Specific     Joseph Maurice Ravel ( French:  ; 7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor  He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy , although both composers rejected the term  In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer   Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire ; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal  After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of modernism, baroque , neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz . He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development  He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known   A slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries  Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music  Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration  Some of his piano music, such as Gaspard de la nuit (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chloé (1912) require skilful balance in performance   Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public  From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision   Ravel was born in the Basque town of Ciboure , France, near Biarritz , 18 kilometres (11 mi) from the Spanish border  His father, Pierre-Joseph Ravel , was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in Versoix near the Franco-Swiss border  His mother, Marie, née Delouart, was Basque but had grown up in Madrid  In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status – Marie was illegitimate and barely literate – but the marriage was a happy one  Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early internal combustion engine and a notorious circus machine, the Whirlwind of Death, an automotive loop-the-loop that was a major attraction until a fatal accident at Barnum and Bailey's Circus in 1903   Both Ravel's parents were Roman Catholics ; Marie was also something of a free-thinker , a trait inherited by her elder son  He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born  The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born  (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession ) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music  Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him  The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods   Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general  In later life, Ravel recalled, Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music  My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age  There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father   When he was seven, Ravel started piano lessons with Henry Ghys, a friend of Emmanuel Chabrier ; five years later, in 1887, he began studying harmony , counterpoint and composition with Charles-René, a pupil of Léo Delibes . Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy  Charles-René found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort  Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by Schumann , variations on a theme by Grieg and a single movement of a piano sonata  They survive only in fragmentary form   In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist Ricardo Viñes , who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music  The two shared an appreciation of Wagner , Russian music, and the writings of Poe , Baudelaire and Mallarmé . At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov . This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy , as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan , also heard during the Exposition   Émile Decombes took over as Ravel's piano teacher in 1889; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance  Aged fourteen, he took part in a concert at the Salle Érard along with other pupils of Decombes, including Reynaldo Hahn and Alfred Cortot .  With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the Conservatoire de Paris . In November 1889, playing music by Chopin , he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eugène Anthiome  Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student  Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer  The musicologist Arbie Orenstein writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period of immense growth   ... from adolescence to maturity   In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot , for piano, and Émile Pessard , for harmony  He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from Bériot but, in the words of the musicologist Barbara L. Kelly , he was only teachable on his own terms  His later teacher Gabriel Fauré understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s  Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes  His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: Sérénade grotesque , for piano, and Ballade de la Reine morte d'aimer, a mélodie setting a poem by Roland de Marès (both 1893).  Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Viñes and Cortot were  It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer  From this point he concentrated on composition  His works from the period include the songs Un grand sommeil noir and D'Anne jouant de l'espinette to words by Paul Verlaine and Clément Marot , and the piano pieces Menuet antique and Habanera (for four hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the Rapsodie espagnole . At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie , who was earning a living as a café pianist  Ravel was one of the first musicians – Debussy was another – who recognised Satie's originality and talent  Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them of inestimable value   In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with Fauré, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with André Gedalge . Both these teachers, particularly Fauré, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer  As Ravel's course progressed, Fauré reported a distinct gain in maturity   ... engaging wealth of imagination  Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, Théodore Dubois , who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook  Consequently, according to a fellow student, Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi , he was a marked man, against whom all weapons were good  He wrote some substantial works while studying with Fauré, including the overture Shéhérazade and a violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900  As a former student he was allowed to attend Fauré's classes as a non-participating auditeur until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903   In 1899 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: Pavane pour une infante défunte ( Pavane for a dead princess). It was originally a solo piano work, commissioned by the Princesse de Polignac . In 1897 he conducted the first performance of the Shéhérazade overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics  One described the piece as a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School and called Ravel a mediocrely gifted debutant   ... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years, if he works hard  Another critic, Pierre Lalo , thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven . Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic   From the start of his career, Ravel appeared calmly indifferent to blame or praise  Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine  The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own, perfectionist and severely self-critical  At twenty years of age he was, in the words of the biographer Burnett James, self-possessed, a little aloof, intellectually biased, given to mild banter  He dressed like a dandy and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour  Orenstein comments that, short in stature, light in frame and bony in features, Ravel had the appearance of a well-dressed jockey, whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect  During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century, Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day; from his mid-thirties he was clean-shaven   Around 1900 Ravel and a number of innovative young artists, poets, critics and musicians joined together in an informal group; they came to be known as Les Apaches (The Hooligans), a name coined by Viñes to represent their status as artistic outcasts  They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War, and members stimulated one another with intellectual argument and performances of their works  The membership of the group was fluid, and at various times included Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla as well as their French friends   Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy  Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued for more than ten years  In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique . It divided musical opinion  Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece  The Apaches were loud in their support  The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them   Debussy was widely held to be an impressionist composer – a label he intensely disliked  Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre  Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not  Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship  Ravel wrote that Debussy's genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition  For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy   ... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of symbolism . During the first years of the new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece Jeux d'eau (1901), the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works  Nichols calls the quartet at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence   The two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons  Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other  Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom  Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people  The public tension led to personal estrangement  Ravel said, It's probably better for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons  Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift  In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer Emma Bardac . Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante Misia Edwards and the opera star Lucienne Bréval , contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband    During the first years of the new century Ravel made five attempts to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome , past winners of which included Berlioz , Gounod , Bizet , Massenet and Debussy  In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition  In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy , the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies  In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a furore . He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable  The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu , was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received  L'affaire Ravel became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire   Among those taking a close interest in the controversy was Alfred Edwards , owner and editor of Le Matin , for which Lalo wrote  Edwards was married to Ravel's friend Misia; the couple took Ravel on a seven-week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905, the first time he had travelled abroad   By the latter part of the 1900s Ravel had established a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra  He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed  There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters  The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestrated 1910), Une barque sur l'océan (1906, from the 1905 piano suite Miroirs ), the Habanera section of Rapsodie espagnole (1907–08), Ma mère l'Oye (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911, orchestrated 1912), Alborada del gracioso (from Miroirs , orchestrated 1918) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).  Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them  Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent  Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters  He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound  When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity  The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams , who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08  Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner   ... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto   Vaughan Williams's recollections throw some light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation  Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels, Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women  By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange . Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual  Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry ; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery   Ravel's first concert outside France was in 1909  As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Société des Concerts Français, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation   The Société Nationale de Musique , founded in 1871 to promote the music of rising French composers, had been dominated since the mid-1880s by a conservative faction led by Vincent d'Indy . Ravel, together with several other former pupils of Fauré, set up a new, modernist organisation, the Société Musicale Indépendente, with Fauré as its president  The new society's inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Fauré's song cycle La chanson d'Ève , Debussy's piano suite D'un cahier d'esquisses , Zoltán Kodály 's Six pièces pour piano and the original piano duet version of Ravel's Ma mère l'Oye . The performers included Fauré, Florent Schmitt , Ernest Bloch , Pierre Monteux and, in the Debussy work, Ravel  Kelly considers it a sign of Ravel's new influence that the society featured Satie's music in a concert in January 1911   The first of Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy L'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911  The work had been completed in 1907, but the manager of the Opéra-Comique, Albert Carré , repeatedly deferred its presentation  He was concerned that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the Opéra-Comique's audience  The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular   In 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered  The first, to the orchestrated and expanded version of Ma mère l'Oye , opened at the Théâtre des Arts in January  The reviews were excellent: the Mercure de France called the score absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature  The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the Queen's Hall , London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year  The Times praised the enchantment of the work   ... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing  New York audiences heard the work in the same year  Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was Adélaïde ou le langage des fleurs , danced to the score of Valses nobles et sentimentales , which opened at the Châtelet in April  Daphnis et Chloé opened at the same theatre in June  This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete   Daphnis et Chloé was commissioned in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes . Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine , and designer, Léon Bakst . Fokine had a reputation for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music  This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music  There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work  It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London  The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere   Ravel composed little during 1913  He collaborated with Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky 's unfinished opera Khovanshchina , and his own works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier . In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of The Rite of Spring . Stravinsky later said that Ravel was the only person who immediately understood the music  Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande .  When Germany invaded France in 1914 Ravel tried to join the French Air Force . He considered his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator, but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint  While waiting to be enlisted, Ravel composed Trois Chansons , his only work for a cappella choir, setting his own texts in the tradition of French 16th-century chansons  He dedicated the three songs to people who might help him to enlist  After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist, Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915, when he was forty  Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend's courage: at his age and with his name he could have had an easier place, or done nothing  Some of Ravel's duties put him in mortal danger, driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment  At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother's failing health  His own health also deteriorated; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems, underwent a bowel operation following amoebic dysentery in September 1916, and had frostbite in his feet the following winter   During the war, the Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française was formed by Saint-Saëns, Dubois, d'Indy and others, campaigning for a ban on the performance of contemporary German music  Ravel declined to join, telling the committee of the league in 1916, It would be dangerous for French composers to ignore systematically the productions of their foreign colleagues, and thus form themselves into a sort of national coterie: our musical art, which is so rich at the present time, would soon degenerate, becoming isolated in banal formulas  The league responded by banning Ravel's music from its concerts   Ravel's mother died in January 1917, and he fell into a horrible despair, compounding the distress he felt at the suffering endured by the people of his country during the war  He composed few works in the war years  The Piano Trio was almost complete when the conflict began, and the most substantial of his wartime works is Le tombeau de Couperin , composed between 1914 and 1917  The suite celebrates the tradition of François Couperin , the 18th-century French composer; each movement is dedicated to a friend of Ravel's who died in the war   After the war, those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina  As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, Ravel's emotional equilibrium, so hard won in the previous decade, had been seriously compromised  His output, never large, became smaller  Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era  Fauré wrote to him, I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly  It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor  Ravel was offered the Legion of Honour in 1920, and although he declined the decoration, he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie's protégés Les Six as an establishment figure  Satie had turned against him, and commented, Ravel refuses the Légion d'honneur, but all his music accepts it  Despite this attack, Ravel continued to admire Satie's early music, and always acknowledged the older man's influence on his own development  Ravel took a benign view of Les Six, promoting their music, and defending it against journalistic attacks  He regarded their reaction against his works as natural, and preferable to their copying his style  Through the Société Musicale Indépendente, he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries  The Société presented concerts of recent works by American composers including Aaron Copland , Virgil Thomson and George Antheil and by Vaughan Williams and his English colleagues Arnold Bax and Cyril Scott .  Orenstein and Zank both comment that, although Ravel's post-war output was small, averaging only one composition a year, it included some of his finest works  In 1920 he completed La valse , in response to a commission from Diaghilev  He had worked on it intermittently for some years, planning a concert piece, a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz, mingled with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, fatal whirling  It was rejected by Diaghilev, who said, It's a masterpiece, but it's not a ballet  It's the portrait of a ballet  Ravel heard Diaghilev's verdict without protest or argument, left, and had no further dealings with him  Nichols comments that Ravel had the satisfaction of seeing the ballet staged twice by other managements before Diaghilev died  A ballet danced to the orchestral version of Le tombeau de Couperin was given at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in November 1920, and the premiere of La valse followed in December  The following year Daphnis et Chloé and L'heure espagnole were successfully revived at the Paris Opéra   In the post-war era there was a reaction against the large-scale music of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss . Stravinsky, whose Rite of Spring was written for a huge orchestra, began to work on a much smaller scale  His 1923 ballet score Les noces is composed for voices and twenty-one instruments  Ravel did not like the work (his opinion caused a cooling in Stravinsky's friendship with him) but he was in sympathy with the fashion for dépouillement – the stripping away of pre-war extravagance to reveal the essentials  Many of his works from the 1920s are noticeably sparer in texture than earlier pieces  Other influences on him in this period were jazz and atonality . Jazz was popular in Parisian cafés, and French composers such as Darius Milhaud incorporated elements of it in their work  Ravel commented that he preferred jazz to grand opera , and its influence is heard in his later music  Arnold Schönberg 's abandonment of conventional tonality also had echoes in some of Ravel's music such as the Chansons madécasses (1926), which Ravel doubted he could have written without the example of Pierrot Lunaire . His other major works from the 1920s include the orchestral arrangement of Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition (1922), the opera L'enfant et les sortilèges to a libretto by Colette (1926), Tzigane (1924) and the Violin Sonata (1927).  Finding city life fatiguing, Ravel moved to the countryside  In May 1921 he took up residence at Le Belvédère, a small house on the fringe of Montfort-l'Amaury , 50 kilometres (31 mi) west of Paris, in the Yvelines département . Looked after by a devoted housekeeper, Mme Revelot, he lived there for the rest of his life  At Le Belvédère Ravel composed and gardened, when not performing in Paris or abroad  His touring schedule increased considerably in the 1920s, with concerts in Britain, Sweden, Denmark, the US, Canada, Spain, Austria and Italy   Arbie Orenstein  After two months of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting  His fee was a guaranteed minimum of $ 10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes  He appeared with most of the leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities  Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary  At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York, the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat  Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed, You know, this doesn't happen to me in Paris  Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel's international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe's house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon . Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity  He commented that the critics' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, when they called him the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion   The last composition Ravel completed in the 1920s, Boléro , became his most famous  He was commissioned to provide a score for Ida Rubinstein 's ballet company, and having been unable to secure the rights to orchestrate Albéniz 's Iberia , he decided on an experiment in a very special and limited direction   ... a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of orchestral tissue without music  Ravel continued that the work was one long, very gradual crescendo  There are no contrasts, and there is practically no invention except the plan and the manner of the execution  The themes are altogether impersonal  He was astonished, and not wholly pleased, that it became a mass success  When one elderly member of the audience at the Opéra shouted Rubbish  at the premiere, he remarked, That old lady got the message  The work was popularised by the conductor Arturo Toscanini , and has been recorded several hundred times  Ravel commented to Arthur Honegger , one of Les Six, I've written only one masterpiece – Boléro . Unfortunately there's no music in it   At the beginning of the 1930s Ravel was working on two piano concertos  He completed the Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand first  It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein , who had lost his right arm during the war  Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project: In a work of this kind, it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands  Ravel, not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand, demonstrated it with both hands  Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece, but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work  In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim, and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year  The critic Henry Prunières wrote, From the opening measures, we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us   The Piano Concerto in G major was completed a year later  After the premiere in January 1932 there was high praise for the soloist, Marguerite Long, and for Ravel's score, though not for his conducting  Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting; they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted   Igor Stravinsky  In October 1932 Ravel suffered a blow to the head in a taxi accident  The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition  As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia . Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score  Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée . The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription  Ravel composed no more after this  The exact nature of his illness is unknown  Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour , and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia , Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease . Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months  Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head   In 1937 Ravel began to suffer pain from his condition, and was examined by Clovis Vincent , a well-known Paris neurosurgeon  Vincent advised surgical treatment  He thought a tumour unlikely, and expected to find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing  Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view  After the operation there seemed to be an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma  He died on 28 December, at the age of 62   On 30 December 1937 Ravel was interred next to his parents in a granite tomb at Levallois-Perret cemetery , in north-west Paris  He was an atheist and there was no religious ceremony   Marcel Marnat 's catalogue of Ravel's complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned  Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries, it is nevertheless inflated by Ravel's frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra  The performable body of works numbers about sixty; slightly more than half are instrumental  Ravel's music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera and song cycles  He wrote no symphonies or church works   Ravel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy  Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert , Liszt and Chopin  He considered himself in many ways a classicist , often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary , to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies  The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata   Ravel to Vaughan Williams  Ravel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is an implied melodic outline in all vital music  His themes are frequently modal instead of using the familiar major or minor scales  As a result, there are few leading notes in his output  Chords of the ninth and eleventh and unresolved appoggiaturas , such as those in the Valses nobles et sentimentales , are characteristic of Ravel's harmonic language   Dance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the bolero and pavane, but also the minuet , forlane , rigaudon , waltz , czardas , habanera and passacaglia . National and regional consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to Hebraic , Greek , Hungarian and gypsy themes  He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired – Borodin , Chabrier, Fauré and Haydn , interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style  Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion, with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude   Ravel completed two operas, and worked on three others  The unrealised three were Olympia , La cloche engloutie and Jeanne d'Arc . Olympia was to be based on Hoffmann 's The Sandman ; he made sketches for it in 1898–99, but did not progress far  La cloche engloutie after Hauptmann 's The Sunken Bell occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912, Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works, except for a Symphonie horlogère which he incorporated into the opening of L'heure espagnole . The third unrealised project was an operatic version of Joseph Delteil 's 1925 novel about Joan of Arc . It was to be a large-scale, full-length work for the Paris Opéra, but Ravel's final illness prevented him from writing it   Ravel's first completed opera was L'heure espagnole (premiered in 1911), described as a comédie musicale  It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career  Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects  Edward Burlingame Hill found Ravel's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action, and commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage  Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity  The critic David Murray writes that the score glows with the famous Ravel tendresse .  The second opera, also in one act, is L'enfant et les sortilèges (1926), a fantaisie lyrique to a libretto by Colette  She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto  It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than L'heure espagnole , and the jazz elements and bitonality of much of the work upset many Parisian opera-goers  Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work  The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout   Although one-act operas are generally staged less often than full-length ones, Ravel's are produced regularly in France and abroad   A substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal  His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome  His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as a static, recitative-like vocal style, prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility  By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in Histoires naturelles . The same technique is highlighted in Trois poèmes de Mallarmé (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided  In the cycles Shéhérazade and Chansons madécasses , Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment   Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as Cinq mélodies populaires grecques , Deux mélodies hébraïques and Chants populaires . Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue , Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine  For three songs dating from 1914–15, he wrote his own texts   Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices  Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade , to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score   During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous  He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use  The critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote, In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a pp tam-tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another   For all Ravel's orchestral mastery, only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra: Rapsodie espagnole , La valse and the two concertos  All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in Daphnis et Chloé , or as a reworking of piano pieces, Alborada del gracioso and Une barque sur l'ocean , ( Miroirs ), Valses nobles et sentimentales, Ma mère l'Oye , Tzigane (originally for violin and piano) and Le tombeau de Couperin  In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms  Occasionally, as in the Alborada del gracioso , critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original   In some of his scores from the 1920s, including Daphnis et Chloé , Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six to eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility  His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points  In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures  The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of Mozart and Saint-Saëns, alongside use of jazz-like themes  The critics Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor comment that in the slow movement, one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented, the composer can truly be said to join hands with Mozart  The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, Boléro (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm   Ravel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann, Chabrier, Debussy and Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition . Orchestral versions of the last by Mikhail Tushmalov , Sir Henry Wood and Leo Funtek predated Ravel's 1922 version, and many more have been made since, but Ravel's remains the best known  Kelly remarks on its dazzling array of instrumental colour, and a contemporary reviewer commented on how, in dealing with another composer's music, Ravel had produced an orchestral sound wholly unlike his own   Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch from the striking simplicity of Ma mère l'Oye to the transcendental virtuosity of Gaspard de la nuit . Ravel's earliest major work for piano, Jeux d'eau (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later  When writing for solo piano, Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity  The authors of The Record Guide consider that works such as Gaspard de la Nuit and Miroirs have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself   Most of Ravel's piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges  Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing  It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in Alborada del gracioso   ... and the two outer movements of Gaspard de la nuit . Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale  This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in Gaspard de la nuit , Le gibet would bore the audience to death  Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing   Ravel's regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works; Menuet sur le nom de Haydn (1909), À la manière de Borodine (1912), À la manière de Chabrier (1913) and Le tombeau de Couperin all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically Ravellian manner  Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions: Listen to Le tombeau de Couperin and the complete ballet music for Ma mère L'Oye in the classic recordings conducted by André Cluytens , and the piano versions never sound quite the same again   Apart from a one-movement sonata for violin and piano dating from 1899, unpublished in the composer's lifetime, Ravel wrote seven chamber works  The earliest is the String Quartet (1902–03), dedicated to Fauré, and showing the influence of Debussy's quartet of ten years earlier  Like the Debussy, it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers, with more succinct melodies, fluently interchanged, in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour  The Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet (1905) was composed very quickly by Ravel's standards  It is an ethereal piece in the vein of the Pavane pour une infante défunte . Ravel also worked at unusual speed on the Piano Trio (1914) to complete it before joining the French Army  It contains Basque, Baroque and far Eastern influences, and shows Ravel's growing technical skill, dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello, blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own, in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson   Ravel's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920–22), the Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Fauré for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of Tzigane for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923–27). The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel's teacher, and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist Jelly d'Arányi . The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody  His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work  Ravel said that the violin and piano are essentially incompatible instruments, and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility  Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor consider the post-war sonatas rather laboured and unsatisfactory, and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel's pre-war chamber works   Ravel's interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on piano roll between 1914 and 1928, although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by Robert Casadesus , a better pianist  Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc  In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of Jeux d'eau played by Mark Hambourg , and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the Pavane pour une infante défunte and Ondine , and movements from the String Quartet, Le tombeau de Couperin and Ma mère l'Oye . Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public, and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works, some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor  A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as Conducted by the composer, although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton  Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a Boléro in 1930, and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist   Ravel declined not only the Légion d'honneur, but all state honours from France, refusing to let his name go forward for election to the Institut de France . He accepted foreign awards, including honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921, the Belgian Ordre de Léopold in 1926, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1928   After Ravel's death, his brother and legatee, Edouard, turned the composer's house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it  As of 2018 the maison-musée de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours   In his later years, Edouard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind  After his death in 1960, the estate passed through several hands  Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were  The British newspaper The Guardian reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair      Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns ( French:  ; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era . His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (Organ) Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886).  Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten  After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri , Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine , the official church of the French Empire . After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas   As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann , Liszt and Wagner , although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition  He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers  This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six , he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death   Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years  It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré , among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel . Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius   Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin  Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris , and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice , always considered himself a true Parisian  Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption (tuberculosis) on the first anniversary of his marriage  The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil , 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris   When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson  Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano  His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty , a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner . Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training  Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young  The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart  The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel , in a programme that included Mozart 's Piano Concerto in B ♭ ( K 450), and Beethoven 's Third Piano Concerto . Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher Alexandre Pierre François Boëly . From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of Bach , which was then little known in France   As a schoolboy Saint-Saëns was outstanding in many subjects  In addition to his musical prowess, he distinguished himself in the study of French literature, Latin and Greek, divinity, and mathematics  His interests included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life   In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire , France's foremost music academy  The director, Daniel Auber , had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative  Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist  His organ professor was François Benoist , whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam , César Franck , Charles Alkan , Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet . In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies  His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy , whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet   Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo . He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome , in 1852 but was unsuccessful  Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen , who made little mark during the rest of his career  In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile , for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize  The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).  On leaving the Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns accepted the post of organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville . The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year there were more than two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income  The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot , had been badly damaged in the aftermath of the French Revolution and imperfectly restored  The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered  With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E ♭ (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire . The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile   Among the musicians who were quick to spot Saint-Saëns's talent were the composers Gioachino Rossini , Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt , and the influential singer Pauline Viardot , who all encouraged him in his career  In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of La Madeleine , the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world   Although in later life he had a reputation for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner . Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions  He commented, I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character  They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me  But I am not, I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion   In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France  Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies  He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner  His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré , recalled in old age:  After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known  ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I had for him, throughout my life   Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager ). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals , with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school   In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome  Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer  He was once more unsuccessful  Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote:  We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy  We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing  I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity  But the other man, who is still a student, has that inner fire, inspiration, he feels, he can do things that can't be learnt and the rest he'll learn more or less  So I voted for him, sighing at the thought of the unhappiness that this failure must cause Saint-Saëns  But, whatever else, one must be honest   According to the musical scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his well-known bon mot about Saint-Saëns, He knows everything, but lacks inexperience (Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience). The winner, Victor Sieg , had a career no more notable than that of the 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency  The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation  He himself wrote, Art is intended to create beauty and character  Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it  In fact, it is very much better off when it does  The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul  The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius, and Bad music well written   While teaching at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of his energy into composing and performing, but after he left in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with vigour  In 1867 his cantata Les noces de Prométhée beat more than a hundred other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi . In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his Second Piano Concerto . Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s   In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine , professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music  Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out  Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war  During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871  With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals  Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society  The Société Nationale de Musique , with its motto, Ars Gallica , had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc , Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members   As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems , Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first poème symphonique was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872  In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged  La princesse jaune (The Yellow Princess), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique , Paris in June  It ran for five performances   Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother  In 1875, he surprised many by marrying  The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils  The marriage was not a success  In the words of the biographer Sabina Teller Ratner, Saint-Saëns's mother disapproved, and her son was difficult to live with  Saint-Saëns and his wife moved to the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince , in the Latin Quarter ; his mother moved with them  The couple had two sons, both of whom died in infancy  In 1878, the elder, André, aged two, fell from a window of the flat and was killed; the younger, Jean-François, died of pneumonia six weeks later, aged six months  Saint-Saëns and Marie-Laure continued to live together for three years, but he blamed her for André's accident; the double blow of their loss effectively destroyed the marriage   For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music  Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere  In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged  His four-act drame lyricque, Le timbre d'argent (The Silver Bell), to Jules Barbier 's and Michel Carré 's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production  The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances   The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition  Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died  He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities  After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all  He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted   In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila , his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire  Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation  Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892   Saint-Saëns was a keen traveller  From the 1870s until the end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries  His professional engagements took him most often to Germany and England; for holidays, and to avoid Parisian winters which affected his weak chest, he favoured Algiers and various places in Egypt   Saint-Saëns was elected to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878  In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday  On 28 July he disappeared from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say that he would not be returning  They never saw each other again  Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five  Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman  Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women  After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle  Marie told him, For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here   In the 1880s Saint-Saëns continued to seek success in the opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it was unthinkable that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera  He had two operas staged during the decade, the first being Henry VIII (1883) commissioned by the Paris Opéra  Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Saëns, normally a fluent, even facile composer, worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England  The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer's lifetime  When it was produced at Covent Garden in 1898, The Era commented that though French librettists generally make a pretty hash of British history, this piece was not altogether contemptible as an opera story   The open-mindedness of the Société Nationale had hardened by the mid-1880s into a dogmatic adherence to Wagnerian methods favoured by Franck's pupils, led by Vincent d'Indy . They had begun to dominate the organisation and sought to abandon its Ars Gallica ethos of commitment to French works  Bussine and Saint-Saëns found this unacceptable, and resigned in 1886  Having long pressed the merits of Wagner on a sometimes sceptical French public, Saint-Saëns was now becoming worried that the German's music was having an excessive impact on young French composers  His increasing caution towards Wagner developed in later years into stronger hostility, directed as much at Wagner's political nationalism as at his music   By the 1880s Saint-Saëns was an established favourite with audiences in England, where he was widely regarded as the greatest living French composer  In 1886 the Philharmonic Society of London commissioned what became one of his most popular and respected works, the Third (Organ) Symphony . It was premiered in London at a concert in which Saint-Saëns appeared as conductor of the symphony and as soloist in Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto , conducted by Sir Arthur Sullivan . The success of the symphony in London was considerable, but was surpassed by the ecstatic welcome the work received at its Paris premiere early the following year  Later in 1887 Saint-Saëns's drame lyrique Proserpine opened at the Opéra-Comique  It was well received and seemed to be heading for a substantial run when the theatre burnt down within weeks of the premiere and the production was lost   In December 1888 Saint-Saëns's mother died  He felt her loss deeply, and was plunged into depression and insomnia, even contemplating suicide  He left Paris and stayed in Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose   During the 1890s Saint-Saëns spent much time on holiday, travelling overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before  A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell through in 1893  He wrote one opera, the comedy Phryné (1893), and together with Paul Dukas helped to complete Frédégonde (1895) an opera left unfinished by Ernest Guiraud , who died in 1892  Phryné was well received, and prompted calls for more comic operas at the Opéra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring grand opera . His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement fantasia Africa (1891) and his Fifth (Egyptian) Piano Concerto , which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his début at the Salle Pleyel in 1846  Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother's tutelage and his public's long support   Among the concerts that Saint-Saëns undertook during the decade was one at Cambridge in June 1893, when he, Bruch and Tchaikovsky performed at an event presented by Charles Villiers Stanford for the Cambridge University Musical Society , marking the award of honorary degrees to all three visitors  Saint-Saëns greatly enjoyed the visit, and even spoke approvingly of the college chapel services: The demands of English religion are not excessive  The services are very short, and consist chiefly of listening to good music extremely well sung, for the English are excellent choristers  His mutual regard for British choirs continued for the rest of his life, and one of his last large-scale works, the oratorio The Promised Land , was composed for the Three Choirs Festival of 1913   In 1900, after ten years without a permanent home in Paris, Saint-Saëns took a flat in the rue de Courcelles, not far from his old residence in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré  This remained his home for the rest of his life  He continued to travel abroad frequently, but increasingly often to give concerts rather than as a tourist  He revisited London, where he was always a welcome visitor, went to Berlin, where until the First World War, he was greeted with honour, and travelled in Italy, Spain, Monaco and provincial France  In 1906 and 1909 he made highly successful tours of the United States, as a pianist and conductor  In New York on his second visit he premiered his Praise ye the Lord for double choir, orchestra and organ, which he composed for the occasion   Despite his growing reputation as a musical reactionary, Saint-Saëns was, according to Gallois, probably the only French musician who travelled to Munich to hear the premiere of Mahler 's Eighth Symphony in 1910  Nonetheless, by the 20th century Saint-Saëns had lost much of his enthusiasm for modernism in music  Though he strove to conceal it from Fauré, he did not understand or like the latter's opera Pénélope (1913), of which he was the dedicatee  In 1917 Francis Poulenc , at the beginning of his career as a composer, was dismissive when Ravel praised Saint-Saëns as a genius  By this time, various strands of new music were emerging with which Saint-Saëns had little in common  His classical instincts for form put him at odds with what seemed to him the shapelessness and structure of the musical impressionists, led by Debussy  Nor did the theories of Arnold Schönberg 's dodecaphony commend themselves to Saint-Saëns:  There is no longer any question of adding to the old rules new principles which are the natural expression of time and experience, but simply of casting aside all rules and every restraint  Everyone ought to make his own rules  Music is free and unlimited in its liberty of expression  There are no perfect chords, dissonant chords or false chords  All aggregations of notes are legitimate  That is called, and they believe it, the development of taste .  Holding such conservative views, Saint-Saëns was out of sympathy – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty  It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky 's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913  In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane   When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music during the First World War, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with their old teacher  They were privately concerned that their friend was in danger of looking foolish with his excess of patriotism, and his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy's En blanc et noir (1915): We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the cubist pictures  His determination to block Debussy's candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer's supporters  Saint-Saëns's response to the neoclassicism of Les Six was equally uncompromising: of Darius Milhaud 's polytonal symphonic suite Protée (1919) he commented, fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France   Saint-Saëns gave what he intended to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance as a result of the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities  These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German warships   In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut for a large invited audience; it was remarked that his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his personal bearing was admirable for a man of eighty-six  He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do  While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921  His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the cimetière du Montparnasse . Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881   In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Saëns in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians wrote:  Saint-Saëns is a consummate master of composition, and no one possesses a more profound knowledge than he does of the secrets and resources of the art; but the creative faculty does not keep pace with the technical skill of the workman  His incomparable talent for orchestration enables him to give relief to ideas which would otherwise be crude and mediocre in themselves ... his works are on the one hand not frivolous enough to become popular in the widest sense, nor on the other do they take hold of the public by that sincerity and warmth of feeling which is so convincing   Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saëns was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past  In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic D   C   Parker wrote, That Saint-Saëns knows Rameau   ... Bach and Handel , Haydn and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings  His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art   Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Saëns often favoured self-contained melodies  Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, supple and pliable, more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the phrase pattern AABB is characteristic  An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him  Grove observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring  In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar  Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although Grove points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works   The authors of the 1955 The Record Guide , Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor write that Saint-Saëns's brilliant musicianship was instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the fact that there are other forms of music besides opera  In the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary , Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Saëns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c.1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia  Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable  The Urbs Roma Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and thick and heavy in its effect  Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of fugal writing  The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ  It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune  The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Saëns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885). The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring motif treated in a Lisztian style of thematic transformation .  Saint-Saëns's four symphonic poems follow the model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the vulgar blatancy to which the earlier composer was prone  The most popular of the four is Danse macabre (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight  Saint-Saëns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation, but in this piece he featured the xylophone prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers  Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871) was composed soon after the horrors of the Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies  Rees rates Phaëton (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer's professed indifference to melody, and inspired in its depiction of the mythical hero and his fate  A critic at the time of the premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece  The last of the four symphonic poems, La jeunesse d'Hercule (Hercules's Youth, 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful  In the judgment of the critic Roger Nichols these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel   Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, Javot (1896), the score for the film L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), and incidental music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916  Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier .  Saint-Saëns was the first major French composer to write piano concertos  His First , in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the Second , in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works  The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary sonata form first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn cadenza . The scherzo second movement and presto finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist Zygmunt Stojowski commented that the work begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach  The Third Piano Concerto , in E ♭ (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines  The Fourth , in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second  It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos  According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns the Beethoven of France (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor  The work is known as the Egyptian concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in Luxor , and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing   The First Cello Concerto , in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section  It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by Pablo Casals and later players  The Second , in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections  It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saint-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult  There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's Second , in C major  The First, in A, was also completed in 1858  It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour  The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime  The Third , in B minor, written for Pablo de Sarasate , is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity  It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso , in A minor, Op  28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863  It changes from a wistful and tense opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, After a multi-stopped cadenza ... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major   Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde , Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques . During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work  The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior  In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics  Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune , which Harding describes as like Sullivan with a light French touch   Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s  In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content   ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable  Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models  From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs , which, like Massenet, he used sparingly  Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less variety of tempo within individual numbers  In a survey of recorded opera Alan Blyth writes that Saint-Saëns certainly learned much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of Aida , and Wagner, but from these excellent models he forged his own style   From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies , writing more than 140  He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder . Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (Persian Songs, 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (The Red Ash Tree, 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo ; others included Alphonse de Lamartine , Pierre Corneille , Amable Tastu , and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet  He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable  Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including Le lever du soleil sur le Nil (Sunrise over the Nile, 1898) and Hymne à la paix (Hymn to Peace, 1919), are for voice and orchestra  His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy .  Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios  Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein . He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence , of oratorio  He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra  In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre  In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Saëns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it   Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark  Nichols excepts the Étude en forme de valse (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique  Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed the French Beethoven, and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E ♭ (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas  He is not known even to have contemplated writing one  There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns's works for the piano are single short pieces  In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as Souvenir d'Italie (1887), Les cloches du soir (Evening bells, 1889) and Souvenir d'Ismaïlia (1895).  Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo  Some of them were written for use in church services – Offertoire (1853), Bénédiction nuptiale (1859), Communion (1859) and others  After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former   Saint-Saëns wrote more than forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years  One of the first of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, confident piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other cantabile . The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms  At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of baroque composers including Rameau and Lully .  Sabina Teller Ratner, 2005  In Ratner's view, the most important of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment  The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by Grove's Dictionary as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions  The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards  The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier  It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment  Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance  The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo   The woodwind sonatas are among the composer's last works  Ratner writes of them, The spare, evocative, classical lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement  Gallois comments that the Oboe Sonata begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of tarantella . For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata is the most important of the three: he calls it a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism amounting to a summary of the rest  The work contrasts a doleful threnody  in the slow movement with the finale, which pirouettes in 4/4 time, in a style reminiscent of the 18th century  The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata a model of transparency, vitality and lightness, containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation   The composer's most famous work, The Carnival of the Animals (1887), although far from a typical chamber piece, is written for eleven players, and is considered by Grove's Dictionary to be part of Saint-Saëns's chamber output  Grove rates it as his most brilliant comic work, parodying Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Rossini, his own Danse macabre and several popular tunes  He forbade performances of it during his lifetime, concerned that its frivolity would damage his reputation as a serious composer   Saint-Saëns was a pioneer in recorded music  In June 1904 The Gramophone Company of London sent its producer Fred Gaisberg to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the mezzo-soprano Meyriane Héglon in arias from Ascanio and Samson et Dalila , and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra). Saint-Saëns made more recordings for the company in 1919   In the early days of the LP record , Saint-Saëns's works were patchily represented on disc  The Record Guide (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of Danse Macabre , The Carnival of the Animals , the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works  In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD  The 2008 Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Saëns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets  Also listed are an early Mass, collections of organ music, and choral songs  A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Saëns's mélodies was released in 1997   With the exception of Samson et Dalila the operas have been sparsely represented on disc  A recording of Henry VIII was issued on CD and DVD in 1992  Hélène was released on CD in 2008  There are several recordings of Samson et Dalilah , under conductors including Sir Colin Davis , Georges Prêtre , Daniel Barenboim and Myung-Whun Chung .  Saint-Saëns was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1867 and promoted to Officier in 1884, and Grand Croix in 1913  Foreign honours included the British Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1902, and honorary doctorates from the universities of Cambridge (1893) and Oxford (1907).  In its obituary notice, The Times commented:  The death of M. Saint-Saëns not only deprives France of one of her most distinguished composers; it removes from the world the last representative of the great movements in music which were typical of the 19th century  He had maintained so vigorous a vitality and kept in such close touch with present-day activities that, though it had become customary to speak of him as the doyen of French composers, it was easy to forget the place he actually took in musical chronology  He was only two years younger than Brahms, was five years older than Tchaikovsky, six years older than Dvořák , and seven years older than Sullivan  He held a position in his own country's music certain aspects of which may be fitly compared with each of those masters in their own spheres   In a short poem, Mea culpa, published in 1890 Saint-Saëns accused himself of lack of decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were not for him  An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day  The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form  The critic Henry Colles , wrote, a few days after the composer's death:  In his desire to maintain the perfect equilibrium we find the limitation of Saint-Saëns's appeal to the ordinary musical mind  Saint-Saëns rarely, if ever, takes any risks; he never, to use the slang of the moment, goes off the deep end  All his greatest contemporaries did  Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and even Franck, were ready to sacrifice everything for the end each wanted to reach, to drown in the attempt to get there if necessary  Saint-Saëns, in preserving his equilibrium, allows his hearers to preserve theirs   Grove concludes its article on Saint-Saëns with the observation that although his works are remarkably consistent, it cannot be said that he evolved a distinctive musical style  Rather, he defended the French tradition that threatened to be engulfed by Wagnerian influences and created the environment that nourished his successors   Since the composer's death writers sympathetic to his music have expressed regret that he is known by the musical public for only a handful of his scores such as The Carnival of the Animals , the Second Piano Concerto, the Third Violin Concerto, the Organ Symphony, Samson et Dalila , Danse macabre and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso  Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio , the ballet Javotte , the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces  In 2004, the cellist Steven Isserlis said, Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself ... there are Masses, all of which are interesting  I've played all his cello music and there isn't one bad piece  His works are rewarding in every way  And he's an endlessly fascinating figure      The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975  Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years, they are regarded as one of the most groundbreaking acts in the history of popular music . They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians  Their fashion and hairstyles have been credited as a significant influence on punk image , and they are often associated with anarchism within music   The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten , guitarist Steve Jones , drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock . Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977  Under the management of Malcolm McLaren , the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain  Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single  God Save the Queen , attacking Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they precipitated the punk rock movement  It was banned not only by the BBC but also by nearly every independent radio station, making it the most heavily censored record in British history   The band's only album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols (1977)—a UK number one album—is a staple record of punk rock  In January 1978, at the end of their over-hyped and turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten announced the band's break-up  Over the next few months, the three remaining band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex Pistols' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle . Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen . Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock briefly reunited for a concert tour in 1996   The Sex Pistols have been recognised as an influence on various genres, including grunge , indie , thrash metal and rap . In 2004, Rolling Stone placed them No  58 on its list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols—the four original members plus Vicious—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum a piss stain   The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar  According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments they had stolen  Early line-ups of The Strand—sometimes known as The Swankers—also included Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass  The band members regularly hung out at two clothing shops on the King's Road in Chelsea , London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor's Acme Attractions (where Don Letts worked as manager) and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood 's Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die  McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme  It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the 50's rocker look associated with Marlon Brando . As John Lydon later observed, Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto  The shop became a focal point of the punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious , Marco Pirroni , Gene October , and Mark Stewart , among many others  Jordan , the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look   In early 1974, Jones asked McLaren to manage The Strand  Effectively agreeing, McLaren paid for their first formal rehearsal space  Glen Matlock , an art student who occasionally worked at 'Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die', was recruited as the band's regular bassist  In November, McLaren temporarily relocated to New York City  Before his departure, McLaren and Westwood had conceived a new identity for their shop: renamed Sex , it changed its focus from retro couture to S&amp;M -inspired anti-fashion , with a billing as Specialists in rubberwear, glamourwear &amp; stagewear  After informally managing and promoting the New York Dolls for a few months, McLaren returned to London in May 1975  Inspired by the punk scene that was emerging in Lower Manhattan —in particular by the radical visual style and attitude of Richard Hell , then with Television —McLaren began taking a greater interest in The Strand members   The group had been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes , and had performed publicly for the first time  Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale was kicked out of the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties  According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones &amp; His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group  When those plans fell through, McLaren, Rhodes and the band began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties  As described by Matlock, Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so what we used to do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer  For instance, former singer with boy band Slik and future Ultravox front man Midge Ure claims to have been approached by McLaren, but to have refused the offer  With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation   In August 1975, Bernard Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old King's Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes  Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook  According to Jones, He came in with green hair  I thought he had a really interesting face  I liked his look  He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins  John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart  When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper 's  I'm Eighteen  on the shop jukebox  Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several weeks  During 1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series of concerts in Europe  These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note guitar phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett  The songs provided a fitting summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate  Waters commented: Because I wanted to get as close as possible to what I felt ... indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance of Syd   While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio  Thorgerson recalled that he sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there  He had changed significantly in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him  Waters was reportedly deeply upset by the experience  Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music festival at Knebworth . Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US   In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting them into a recording studio and storage space  In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals , in their newly finished 24-track studio  The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell 's political fable Animal Farm . The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep  Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station , over which they superimposed an image of a pig   The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis  Although Gilmour was largely responsible for Dogs, which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part  Pigs on the Wing . Wright commented: It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there  Mason recalled: Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately  Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album  Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals ; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering  Animals was the first Pink Floyd album with no writing credit for Wright, who said: This was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me   Released in January 1977, Animals peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three  NME described the album as one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright iconoclastic hunks of music, and Melody Maker ' s Karl Dallas called it  uncomfortable taste of reality in a medium that has become in recent years, increasingly soporific   Pink Floyd performed much of Animals during their  In the Flesh  tour  It was their first experience playing large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band  Waters began arriving at each venue alone, departing immediately after the performance  On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to quit  At the Montreal Olympic Stadium , a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters so much that he spat at one of them  The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour, who felt that the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish   In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two ideas for Pink Floyd's next album  The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall; the other later became Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former  Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script for the new album  Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II . This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett  At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person   During the recording of The Wall , the band became dissatisfied with Wright's lack of contribution and fired him  Gilmour said that Wright was dismissed as he hadn't contributed anything of any value whatsoever to the album—he did very, very little  According to Mason, Wright would sit in on the sessions without doing anything, just 'being a producer'. Waters said the band agreed that Wright would either have to have a long battle or agree to leave quietly after the album was finished; Wright accepted the ultimatum and left   The Wall was supported by Pink Floyd's first single since Money,  Another Brick in the Wall (Part II) , which topped the charts in the US and the UK  The Wall was released on 30 November 1979 and topped the Billboard chart in the US for 15 weeks, reaching number three in the UK  It is number three on the RIAA 's list of the all-time Top 100 albums, with 23 million certified units sold in the US  The cover, with a stark brick wall and band name, was the first Pink Floyd album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis   Gerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the Wall tour  He also commissioned the construction of large inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline, including the Mother, the Ex-wife and the Schoolmaster  Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances  Relationships within the band reached an all-time low; their four Winnebagos parked in a circle, the doors facing away from the centre  Waters used his own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band  Wright returned as a paid musician, making him the only band member to profit from the tour, which lost about $600,000 (US$1,687,335 in 2019 dollars ).  The Wall was adapted into a film, Pink Floyd – The Wall . The film was conceived as a combination of live concert footage and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved impractical to film  Alan Parker agreed to direct and took a different approach  The animated sequences remained, but scenes were acted by actors with no dialogue  Waters was screentested, but quickly discarded and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the role of Pink  Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall ' s storyline as bollocks  Eventually won over by the prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work, Geldof agreed  Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd – The Wall premièred in the UK in July 1982   In 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks , originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall  With the onset of the Falklands War , Waters changed direction and began writing new material  He saw Margaret Thatcher 's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father  Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall . Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire  Michael Kamen , a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall , mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright  The tension within the band grew  Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure  After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions   Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album  With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure  Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself  Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US  Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album  Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused  Gilmour later commented: I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut . Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece  Loder viewed The Final Cut as essentially a Roger Waters solo album   Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face , in 1984, and used it to express his feelings about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters  He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd  Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking . Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity , which went almost unnoticed upon its release  Mason released his second solo album, Profiles , in August 1985   Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking , Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite  He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments  O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager  He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs  Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations  Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd  Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him  He went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd a spent force creatively   When Waters' lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name  Gilmour responded with a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist  The sides reached an out-of-court agreement, finalised on Gilmour's houseboat the Astoria on Christmas Eve 1987  In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members   In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason . There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions  Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence would make us stronger legally and musically, and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of $11,000   Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria , moored along the River Thames . The group found it difficult to work without Waters' creative direction; to write lyrics, Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough , eventually choosing Anthony Moore . Wright and Mason were out of practice; Gilmour said they had been destroyed by Roger, and their contributions were minimal   A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987  Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut , designed the album cover  To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle . The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US  Waters commented: I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate  Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: Roger's criticisms are fair  It's not a band album at all  Q magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album   Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name  Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral  Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice  Realising he had taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them  As Pink Floyd toured North America, Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those hosting his former band's performances  Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's use of the flying pig . Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its underside to distinguish it from Waters' design  The parties reached a legal agreement on 23 December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall .  For several years Pink Floyd had busied themselves with personal pursuits, such as filming and competing in the La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event  In January 1993, they began working on a new album, The Division Bell , returning to Britannia Row Studios, where for several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material  After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs  Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about 25 ideas   Contractually, Wright was not a member of the band, and said, It came close to a point where I wasn't going to do the album  However, he earned five co-writing credits, his first on a Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here . Another songwriter credited on the album was Gilmour's future wife, Polly Samson . She helped him write several tracks, including  High Hopes , a collaborative arrangement which, though initially tense, pulled the whole album together, according to Ezrin  They hired Michael Kamen to arrange the album's orchestral parts; Dick Parry and Chris Thomas also returned  Writer Douglas Adams provided the album title and Thorgerson the cover artwork  Thorgerson drew inspiration for the album cover from the Moai monoliths of Easter Island ; two opposing faces forming an implied third face about which he commented: the absent face—the ghost of Pink Floyd's past, Syd and Roger  Eager to avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with A Momentary Lapse , Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would resume touring  The Division Bell reached number 1 in the UK and the US, and spent 51 weeks on the UK chart   Pink Floyd spent more than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California , before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost identical road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour  They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety  The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994  Mason published a memoir, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd , in 2004   On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first time in more than 24 years, at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park , London  The reunion was arranged by Live 8 organiser Bob Geldof ; after Gilmour declined the offer, Geldof asked Mason, who contacted Waters  About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two years, and the next day Gilmour agreed  In a statement to the press, the band stressed the unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event   They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, followed by three days of rehearsals at Black Island Studios  The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of the event  At the beginning of their performance of Wish You Were Here, Waters told the audience:  quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... we're doing this for everyone who's not here, and particularly of course for Syd  At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started to walk off the stage  Waters called him back, and the band shared a group hug  Images of the hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters said of their almost 20 years of animosity: I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity   Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136 million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only  However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen: The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in  It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that  It's just ... I've been there, I've done it  In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica , which declared: Patience for fans in mourning  The news is official  Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased  Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: It's over ... I've had enough  I'm 60 years old ... it is much more comfortable to work on my own  Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite   Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60  His funeral was held at Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended  Wright said: The band are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death  Syd was the guiding light of the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire  Although Barrett had faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to music  On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute concert Madcap's Last Laugh at the Barbican Centre in London  Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed the Barrett compositions  Bike  and Arnold Layne, and Waters performed a solo version of his song Flickering Flame   Wright died of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65  His former bandmates paid tributes to his life and work; Gilmour said: In the welter of arguments about who or what was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten  He was gentle, unassuming and private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised Pink Floyd sound  A week after Wright's death, Gilmour performed Remember a Day from A Saucerful of Secrets , written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute to him on BBC Two's Later .. with Jools Holland . Keyboardist Keith Emerson released a statement praising Wright as the backbone of Pink Floyd   On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation  The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington Hall in Oxfordshire, England, with an audience of approximately 200  In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour performed Comfortably Numb at Waters' performance of The Wall at the London O2 Arena on 12 May 2011, singing the choruses and playing the two guitar solos  Mason also joined, playing tambourine for  Outside the Wall  with Gilmour on mandolin   On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd ...   , reissuing the back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including Experience and Immersion multi-disc multi-format editions  The albums were remastered by James Guthrie , co-producer of The Wall . In November 2015, Pink Floyd released a limited edition EP, 1965: Their First Recordings , comprising six songs recorded prior to The Piper at the Gates of Dawn .  In 2012, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album  They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and generally harness studio technology  Waters was not involved  Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound  Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was   The Endless River was released on 7 November 2014, the second Pink Floyd album distributed by Parlophone following the release of the 20th anniversary editions of The Division Bell earlier in 2014  Though it received mixed reviews, it became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK and debuted at number one in several countries  The vinyl edition was the fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997  Gilmour said The Endless River would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: I think we have successfully commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end  There was no supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was impossible without Wright  In 2015, Gilmour reiterated that Pink Floyd were done and that to reunite without Wright would be wrong  Mason said in 2018 that Gilmour and Waters continued to be at loggerheads   In November 2016, Pink Floyd released a box set, The Early Years 1965–1972 , comprising outtakes, live recordings, remixes, and films from their early career  This was followed in December 2019 by The Later Years , compiling Pink Floyd's work after Waters' departure  The set includes a remixed version of A Momentary Lapse of Reason with more contributions by Wright and Mason, and an expanded reissue of the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder . In 2018, Mason formed a new band, Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets , to perform Pink Floyd's early material  The band includes Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet and longtime Pink Floyd collaborator Guy Pratt . They toured Europe in September 2018 and North America in 2019  Waters joined the band at the New York Beacon Theatre to perform vocals for  Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun .  Considered one of the UK's first psychedelic music groups, Pink Floyd began their career at the vanguard of London's underground music scene, appearing at UFO Club and Middle Earth (club) . According to Rolling Stone : By 1967, they had developed an unmistakably psychedelic sound, performing long, loud suitelike compositions that touched on hard rock , blues, country , folk , and electronic music . Released in 1968, the song Careful with That Axe, Eugene helped galvanise their reputation as an art rock group  Other genres attributed to the band are space rock , experimental rock , acid rock , proto-prog , experimental pop (while under Barrett), psychedelic pop , and psychedelic rock . O'Neill Surber comments on the music of Pink Floyd:  Rarely will you find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or predictable three-chord blues progressions; and never will you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype  Their sonic universe is expansive, intense, and challenging ... Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often seems to have a life of its own ... Pink Floyd employs extended, stand-alone instrumentals which are never mere vehicles for showing off virtuoso but are planned and integral parts of the performance   During the late 1960s, the press labelled their music psychedelic pop, progressive pop and progressive rock ; the band gained a following as a psychedelic pop group  In 1968, Wright commented on Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: It's hard to see why we were cast as the first British psychedelic group  We never saw ourselves that way ... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun ... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted ... the emphasis ... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation  Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: There wasn't anything 'grand' about it  We were laughable  We were useless  We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental' ... Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't want to go back to playing  Interstellar Overdrive  for hours and hours  Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s   —Alan di Perna, in Guitar World , May 2006  Rolling Stone critic Alan di Perna praised Gilmour's guitar work as integral to Pink Floyd's sound, and described him as the most important guitarist of the 1970s, the missing link between Hendrix and Van Halen . Rolling Stone named him the 14th greatest guitarist of all time  In 2006, Gilmour said of his technique:  fingers make a distinctive sound ... aren't very fast, but I think I am instantly recognisable ... The way I play melodies is connected to things like Hank Marvin and the Shadows . Gilmour's ability to use fewer notes than most to express himself without sacrificing strength or beauty drew a favourable comparison to jazz trumpeter Miles Davis .  In 2006, Guitar World writer Jimmy Brown described Gilmour's guitar style as characterised by simple, huge-sounding riffs; gutsy, well-paced solos; and rich, ambient chordal textures  According to Brown, Gilmour's solos on Money,  Time  and  Comfortably Numb  cut through the mix like a laser beam through fog  Brown described the Time solo as a masterpiece of phrasing and motivic development ... Gilmour paces himself throughout and builds upon his initial idea by leaping into the upper register with gut-wrenching one-and-one-half-step 'over bends', soulful triplet arpeggios and a typically impeccable bar vibrato  Brown described Gilmour's phrasing as intuitive and perhaps his best asset as a lead guitarist  Gilmour explained how he achieved his signature tone: I usually use a fuzz box, a delay and a bright EQ setting ... singing sustain ... you need to play loud—at or near the feedback threshold  It's just so much more fun to play ... when bent notes slice right through you like a razor blade   Throughout their career, Pink Floyd experimented with their sound  Their second single, See Emily Play premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967  During the performance, the group first used an early quadraphonic device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator . The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to manipulate the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect  In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system   Waters experimented with the VCS 3 synthesiser on Pink Floyd pieces such as  On the Run ,  Welcome to the Machine , and  In the Flesh  . He used a binson echorec 2 delay effect on his bass-guitar track for  One of These Days .  Pink Floyd used innovative sound effects and state of the art audio recording technology during the recording of The Final Cut . Mason's contributions to the album were almost entirely limited to work with the experimental Holophonic system, an audio processing technique used to simulate a three-dimensional effect  The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones  The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears   Pink Floyd also composed several film scores, starting in 1968, with The Committee . In 1969, they recorded the score for Barbet Schroeder 's film More . The soundtrack proved beneficial: not only did it pay well but, along with A Saucerful of Secrets , the material they created became part of their live shows for some time thereafter  While composing the soundtrack for director Michelangelo Antonioni 's film Zabriskie Point , the band stayed at a luxury hotel in Rome for almost a month  Waters claimed that, without Antonioni's constant changes to the music, they would have completed the work in less than a week  Eventually he used only three of their recordings  One of the pieces turned down by Antonioni, called The Violent Sequence, later became Us and Them, included on 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon . In 1971, the band again worked with Schroeder on the film La Vallée , for which they released a soundtrack album called Obscured by Clouds . They composed the material in about a week at the Château d'Hérouville near Paris, and upon its release, it became Pink Floyd's first album to break into the top 50 on the US Billboard chart   Regarded as pioneers of live music performance and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, making use of innovative sound effects and quadraphonic speaker systems  From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London  Their slide-and-light show was one of the first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground   To celebrate the launch of the London Free School 's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people at the opening of the Roundhouse , attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull . In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers , mirrors and stretched condoms . After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation  On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace , London  Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around three o'clock in the morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise  In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called  Moonhead .  In November 1974, they employed for the first time the large circular screen that would become a staple of their live shows  In 1977, they employed the use of a large inflatable floating pig named Algie  Filled with helium and propane, Algie, while floating above the audience, would explode with a loud noise during the In the Flesh Tour  The behaviour of the audience during the tour, as well as the large size of the venues, proved a strong influence on their concept album The Wall . The subsequent The Wall Tour featured a 40 feet (12 m) high wall, built from cardboard bricks, constructed between the band and the audience  They projected animations onto the wall, while gaps allowed the audience to view various scenes from the story  They commissioned the creation of several giant inflatables to represent characters from the story  One striking feature of the tour was the performance of Comfortably Numb  While Waters sang his opening verse, in darkness, Gilmour waited for his cue on top of the wall  When it came, bright blue and white lights would suddenly reveal him  Gilmour stood on a flightcase on castors, an insecure setup supported from behind by a technician  A large hydraulic platform supported both Gilmour and the tech   During the Division Bell Tour , an unknown person using the name Publius posted a message on an internet newsgroup inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album  White lights in front of the stage at the Pink Floyd concert in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius  During a televised concert at Earls Court on 20 October 1994, someone projected the word enigma in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage  Mason later acknowledged that their record company had instigated the Publius Enigma mystery, rather than the band   Marked by Waters' philosophical lyrics, Rolling Stone described Pink Floyd as purveyors of a distinctively dark vision  Author Jere O'Neill Surber wrote: their interests are truth and illusion, life and death, time and space, causality and chance, compassion and indifference  Waters identified empathy as a central theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd  Author George Reisch described Meddle 's psychedelic opus, Echoes, as built around the core idea of genuine communication, sympathy , and collaboration with others  Despite having been labelled the gloomiest man in rock, author Deena Weinstein described Waters as an existentialist , dismissing the unfavourable moniker as the result of misinterpretation by music critics   Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's  Have a Cigar  deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives  The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes Pink is the name of one of the band members  According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce, a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience   Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd  Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War . Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours  Their film score, Obscured by Clouds , dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing  Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here : The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling  Waters commented: it's about none of us really being there ... should have been called Wish We Were Here .  O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music  Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall , with the lyrics to Comfortably Numb: I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye  I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone  Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, Jugband Blues: I'm most obliged to you for making it clear that I'm not here   Author Patrick Croskery described Animals as a unique blend of the powerful sounds and suggestive themes of Dark Side with The Wall 's portrayal of artistic alienation  He drew a parallel between the album's political themes and that of Orwell's Animal Farm . Animals begins with a thought experiment, which asks: If you didn't care what happened to me  And I didn't care for you, then develops a beast fable based on anthropomorphised characters using music to reflect the individual states of mind of each  The lyrics ultimately paint a picture of dystopia , the inevitable result of a world devoid of empathy and compassion, answering the question posed in the opening lines   The album's characters include the Dogs, representing fervent capitalists, the Pigs, symbolising political corruption, and the Sheep, who represent the exploited  Croskery described the Sheep as being in a state of delusion created by a misleading cultural identity, a false consciousness . The Dog, in his tireless pursuit of self-interest and success, ends up depressed and alone with no one to trust, utterly lacking emotional satisfaction after a life of exploitation  Waters used Mary Whitehouse as an example of a Pig; being someone who in his estimation, used the power of the government to impose her values on society  At the album's conclusion, Waters returns to empathy with the lyrical statement: You know that I care what happens to you  And I know that you care for me too  However, he also acknowledges that the Pigs are a continuing threat and reveals that he is a Dog who requires shelter, suggesting the need for a balance between state, commerce and community, versus an ongoing battle between them   —Waters, quoted in Harris, 2005  O'Neill Surber compared the lyrics of Dark Side of the Moon 's  Brain Damage  with Karl Marx 's theory of self-alienation ; there's someone in my head, but it's not me  The lyrics to Wish You Were Here 's Welcome to the Machine suggest what Marx called the alienation of the thing ; the song's protagonist preoccupied with material possessions to the point that he becomes estranged from himself and others  Allusions to the alienation of man's species being can be found in Animals ; the Dog reduced to living instinctively as a non-human  The Dogs become alienated from themselves to the extent that they justify their lack of integrity as a necessary and defensible position in a cutthroat world with no room for empathy or moral principle wrote Detmer  Alienation from others is a consistent theme in the lyrics of Pink Floyd, and it is a core element of The Wall .  War, viewed as the most severe consequence of the manifestation of alienation from others, is also a core element of The Wall , and a recurring theme in the band's music  Waters' father died in combat during the Second World War, and his lyrics often alluded to the cost of war, including those from Corporal Clegg (1968),  Free Four  (1972),  Us and Them  (1973),  When the Tigers Broke Free  and  The Fletcher Memorial Home  from The Final Cut (1983), an album dedicated to his late father and subtitled A Requiem for the Postwar Dream . The themes and composition of The Wall express Waters' upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the Second World War, a condition that negatively affected his personal relationships with women   Waters' lyrics to The Dark Side of the Moon dealt with the pressures of modern life and how those pressures can sometimes cause insanity  He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition  However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it an exhortation ... to embrace the positive and reject the negative  Reisch described The Wall as less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness  The Wall 's protagonist, Pink, is unable to deal with the circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making  After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is crazy, over the rainbow  He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: have I been guilty all this time  Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him  He then stands trial for showing feelings of an almost human nature, further exacerbating his alienation of species being  As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault , Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies, contribute to his angst, according to Reisch   Pink Floyd are one of the most commercially successful and influential rock bands of all time  They have sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 75 million certified units in the United States, and 37 9 million albums sold in the US since 1993  The Sunday Times Rich List , Music Millionaires 2013 (UK), ranked Waters at number 12 with an estimated fortune of £150 million, Gilmour at number 27 with £85 million and Mason at number 37 with £50 million   In 2004, MSNBC ranked Pink Floyd number 8 on their list of The 10 Best Rock Bands Ever  In the same year, Q named Pink Floyd as the biggest band of all time according to a points system that measured sales of their biggest album, the scale of their biggest headlining show and the total number of weeks spent on the UK album chart  Rolling Stone ranked them number 51 on their list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  VH1 ranked them number 18 in the list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time  Colin Larkin ranked Pink Floyd number 3 in his list of the 'Top 50 Artists of All Time', a ranking based on the cumulative votes for each artist's albums included in his All Time Top 1000 Albums . In 2008, the head rock and pop critic of The Guardian , Alexis Petridis , wrote that the band occupy a unique place in progressive rock, stating, Thirty years on, prog is still persona non grata Only Pink Floyd—never really a prog band, their penchant for long songs and 'concepts' notwithstanding—are permitted into the 100 best album lists   Pink Floyd have won several awards  In 1981 audio engineer James Guthrie won the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Non-Classical Album for The Wall , and Roger Waters won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Original Song Written for a Film in 1983 for Another Brick in the Wall from The Wall film . In 1995, Pink Floyd won the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for  Marooned . In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to modern music; Waters and Mason attended the ceremony and accepted the award  They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, and the Hit Parade Hall of Fame in 2010   Pink Floyd have influenced numerous artists  David Bowie called Barrett a significant inspiration, and The Edge of U2 bought his first delay pedal after hearing the opening guitar chords to  Dogs  from Animals . Other bands and artists who cite them as an influence include Queen , Radiohead , Steven Wilson , Marillion , Queensrÿche , Nine Inch Nails , the Orb and the Smashing Pumpkins . Pink Floyd were an influence on the neo-progressive rock subgenre which emerged in the 1980s  The English rock band Mostly Autumn fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd in their sound   Pink Floyd were admirers of the Monty Python comedy group, and helped finance their 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail . In 2016, Pink Floyd became the second band (after the Beatles ) to feature on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail . In May 2017, to mark the 50th anniversary of Pink Floyd's first single, an audio-visual exhibition, Their Mortal Remains , opened at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London  The exhibition featured analysis of cover art, conceptual props from the stage shows, and photographs from Mason's personal archive  It was extended for two weeks beyond its planned closing date of 1 October   Books  Documentaries     Powderfinger were an Australian rock band formed in Brisbane in 1989  From 1992 until their break-up in 2010, the line-up consisted of vocalist Bernard Fanning , guitarists Darren Middleton and Ian Haug , bass guitarist John Collins and drummer Jon Coghill . The group's third studio album Internationalist peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart in September 1998  They followed with four more number-one studio albums in a row: Odyssey Number Five (September 2000), Vulture Street (July 2003), Dream Days at the Hotel Existence (June 2007) and Golden Rule (November 2009). Their Top Ten hit singles are  My Happiness  (2000),  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind  (2003) and  Lost and Running  (2007). Powderfinger earned a total of eighteen ARIA Awards , making them the second-most awarded band behind Silverchair . Ten Powderfinger albums and DVDs certified multiple- platinum , with Odyssey Number Five – their most successful album – achieving eightfold platinum certification for shipment of over 560,000 units   After the release of their first DVD, These Days: Live in Concert (September 2004), and the compilation album Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 (November 2004), the group announced a hiatus in 2005  The June 2007 announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with Silverchair, Across the Great Divide tour , followed the release of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . Powderfinger were also involved in various philanthropic causes  In 2005, they performed at a WaveAid concert in Sydney , to help raise funds for areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake . Another performance at the Sydney Opera House in October 2007 raised funds for breast cancer victims and their families  One aim of their Across the Great Divide Tour was to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia , and awareness of the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children  In April 2010 Powderfinger announced that they would be breaking up after their Sunsets Farewell Tour , declaring it would be their last ever as they had musically said everything they wanted to say  On 13 November 2010, they played their last concert, signifying their disbandment  In November the following year, rock music journalist Dino Scatena and Powderfinger published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band   On 23 May 2020, the band reformed for a one-off livestreamed charity performance, One Night Lonely .  Powderfinger were formed in 1989 by Steven Bishop (ex-the Eternal) on drums, John Collins (the Eternal) on bass guitar, and Ian Haug (the Vibrants, the Fossils) on guitar and vocals  The Eternal, the Vibrants, and the Fossils were other Brisbane-based outfits  All three members of Powderfinger were students at Brisbane Grammar School – a private school in Spring Hill – and they started as a cover band playing pub rock classics by the Rolling Stones , the Doors , Led Zeppelin , Steppenwolf , Rodriguez , and Neil Young . The band's name comes from Young's song of the same name . Despite their popularity in Brisbane, when playing a heavy metal gig in Newcastle, New South Wales , in 1990, Powderfinger were booed off stage   After completing secondary education, Collins and Haug attended the University of Queensland , where the latter met Bernard Fanning in an economics class – and learned that Fanning had similar interests in music and could sing  Fanning took over the role of lead vocals from Haug and also provided guitar and harmonica  Late in 1990, Jon Coghill – another university student with Fanning and Haug – replaced Bishop on drums, which was described as a mutual leaving  Bishop later worked in London-based bands based in London, UK , before returning to Brisbane where he was a member of Moonjuice and then the Haymakers  Powderfinger's final line-up change was in 1992 with the addition of Darren Middleton (The Pirates) on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals  Powderfinger initially performed cover versions of other artists' songs, but gradually developed by writing and performing their own material   In August 1992, the group self-funded a seven-track self-titled extended play , also known as the Blue EP , on their own Finger label, and the album was distributed by MDS  It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane  The EP has an early version of  Save Your Skin , co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton, and Fanning; it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a single from their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears . Their second EP, Transfusion , was issued in September 1993 and distributed by Polydor Records . At that time, Simon McKenzie of Time Off noted they were hoping the major label will put a bit of weight behind the disc, but it's not as though they've signed a record deal or anything  McKenzie felt the EP showed they were wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, but is it also a reaction against the sixties tags they've been stuck with . The five tracks include Reap What You Sow, which reached the No  1 spot on the ARIA Alternative Singles Chart , replacing Nirvana 's  Heart-Shaped Box . The group recorded their first music video , for Reap What You Sow; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos  After the EP's success, the group were signed by Polydor   In January 1994, Powderfinger performed on the Big Day Out Tour (see 1994 line-up ). On 18 July that year, they released their debut studio album, Parables for Wooden Ears , under Polydor  According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane , it featured complex, meticulously crafted rock but was somewhat ponderous and sombre, which did little to fulfil the promise displayed on Transfusion . The album was produced by Tony Cohen ( Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds , The Cruel Sea ), and Fanning later described it as the band's dark dark days  It received limited radio coverage  Supporting the album's release, the band toured heavily, appearing at the Livid and Homebake music festivals  Powderfinger supported United States visitors Pantera on that group's Driven Downunder Tour '94  Another Australian support act on the tour was Newcastle-formed band Silverchair . Three singles were released from Powderfinger's debut album –  Tail ,  Grave Concern , and  Save Your Skin  – but none appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top 50  Following the album's release and lukewarm reception, in April 1995, the band recorded at Melbourne's Metropolis Studio with Lachlan Magoo Goold ( Regurgitator ) and in July released a five-track EP, Mr Kneebone .  The band's second studio album, Double Allergic , was issued on 2 September 1996; it peaked at No  4 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified triple  platinum by ARIA for shipment of 210,000 units by 2007  It was co-produced by Tim Whitten and the group  McFarlane felt this album was more self-assured and textured consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene, alongside the likes of You Am I , Spiderbait , Silverchair, Regurgitator and Tumbleweed  was full of accessible, spirited rock  Australian rock music journalist Ed Nimmervoll noted  revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves  Powderfinger's reason to be is to create songs strong enough for the band and audience to play and hear months or years down the line  Four singles were released from the album –  Pick You Up ,  D.A.F. ,  Living Type , and  Take Me In . Take Me In was released as a video single featuring several other music videos by the group  FasterLouder, a music review web site, recalled that when Double Allergic was released in 1996, it showed the band were here for the long haul to become arguably one of the best of the decade  In 1997 the album was issued in Canada and the group toured North America to promote it   On 7 September 1998, Powderfinger released their third studio album, Internationalist , which peaked at No  1 and spent 101 weeks in the Top 50 of the ARIA Albums Chart; it was produced by Nick DiDia ( Rage Against the Machine , Pearl Jam ). AllMusic 's Jonathan Lewis had mixed feelings about the album  He was enchanted by its lead single,  The Day You Come , however the rest of the album didn't measure up except for some fine tracks in Don't Wanna Be Left Out and Already Gone  Nevertheless, by 2007 the album had shipped over 350,000 copies and was certified five times platinum domestically, and had reached European audiences  Internationalist was the first Powderfinger album to win any ARIA Music Awards . At the 1999 ceremony it won Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Kevin Wilkins), and The Day You Come won Single of the Year   Passenger , another single from Internationalist , was nominated for three additional categories in the following year . The band was both praised and criticised for their political views on Internationalist . In a November 1998 interview with Benedict Watts of Juice Magazine , Haug said that political messages in The Day You Come were not something they were just preaching about, but rather were something they saw as a responsibility   Powderfinger's fourth studio album, Odyssey Number Five , was released on 4 September 2000, and also peaked at No  1. Entertainment Weekly ' s Marc Weingarten provided a positive review and found the group prove that there's still terrain left to be explored guitar rock ... melancholy is the default mode ... can be as prim as Travis or as mock-grandiose as Oasis . However, Allmusic's Dean Carlson was more negative, seeing the album as little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American grunge . Odyssey Number Five is Powderfinger's most commercially successful album, shipping 560,000 copies and certified eight times platinum by 2004  It also appeared on the New Zealand Albums Chart at No  15  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 , the group won Album of the Year, Highest Selling Album, Best Rock Album, Best Cover Art (by Wilkins), and Best Group   Two of Odyssey Number Five ' s tracks featured on film soundtracks:  These Days , written for Two Hands (1999), and  My Kind of Scene  in Mission: Impossible 2 (2000). Singles from the album are My Kind of Scene,  My Happiness ,  Like a Dog , and the double A-side  The Metre / Waiting for the Sun . My Happiness, which peaked at No  4 in Australia and No  7 in New Zealand, is the group's highest-charting single in both countries  At the ARIA Awards ceremony, My Happiness won Single of the Year, and other songs were nominated in various categories  Their tracks received votes from national radio station Triple J 's listeners on annual Hottest 100 lists: These Days, Already Gone,  Good-Day Ray , and Passenger were ranked in 1999 , and My Happiness and My Kind of Scene in 2000 . In 2009, These Days was voted at No  21 and My Happiness at No  27 in the Hottest 100 of all time, placing them as second- and fourth-highest Australian tracks after the Hilltop Hoods '  The Nosebleed Section  and Hunters &amp; Collectors '  Throw Your Arms Around Me , respectively   Powderfinger's Vulture Street was released on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No  1 in Australia, while in New Zealand it reached No  17  Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for the location of the band's first recording room in West End , Brisbane  The Sydney Morning Herald ' s music critic Bernard Zuel approved of a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album with a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect; he felt it had Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut album  Simon Evans of musicOMH described the group as having opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs  Middleton explained that the band's aim was to get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things we grew up loving, which was Bowie , Zeppelin , Kiss ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s  We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it's a very old-school-sounding record  It's all the old amps, we used old guitars and recorded to tape , of course  It's fairly organic in that sense  Vulture Street won four ARIA Awards in 2003 : Album of the Year, Best Group, Best Rock Album, and Best Cover Art (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design). Singles issued from the album are:  (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind ,  Since You've Been Gone ,  Love Your Way , and  Sunsets . Tracks were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004 .  In September 2004 the group issued their first live album, These Days: Live in Concert , initially as a CD , and followed in October with a two-disc DVD . One single,  Stumblin' , which had appeared on Vulture Street , was issued as a live version  In late October they released a compilation album, Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000 , which included many of their singles from the first four albums as well as non-singles Thrilloilogy and Belter, and a re-release of These Days  These Days, although never officially released as a single, was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll of 1999  The album also included two new songs:  Bless My Soul  and Process This, although only Bless My Soul was released as a single  Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger appeared at the WaveAid fundraising concert in January 2005 in Sydney, to raise funds for aid organisations working in the disaster-affected areas  Fanning, as a member of The Wrights , sang lead vocals on  Evie, part 2  at the concert  The Wrights released a studio version in March as a single with some of the proceeds going to tsunami relief efforts   After the WaveAid concert, from early 2005, Powderfinger had a period of hiatus  During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the personal front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife  Middleton's side project, Drag , had issued an EP, Gas Food Lodging , in 2002  Zombos Reviews found the EP was full of well-written jangly pop, and has some rather nice ballads  Their debut album, The Way Out , recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July, was a tad disappointing ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads  Everything's tastefully arranged, and there's always nice melodies and harmonies  Collins and Haug formed The Predators with Powderfinger's former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals  The group released a six-track EP, Pick Up the Pace , in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia   In October 2005 Fanning issued his debut solo album, Tea &amp; Sympathy , which reached No  1 in Australia and No  11 in New Zealand  At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 , Fanning won in four categories including Album of the Year for Tea &amp; Sympathy and Best Video for its lead single,  Wish You Well . Wish You Well was ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll in 2005  At the end of 2006, Fanning toured in support of the album's release in the United Kingdom and North America; at its conclusion, Powderfinger resumed from their hiatus  Fanning compared his solo work to Powderfinger recordings, saying, when a problem came up in the studio, especially guitar-wise, I've always had Darren and Ian to call on  They could usually come up with something good  But I played all the guitar on it, and my abilities are fairly limited and that Powderfinger is my real job and I'm looking forward to doing it again   Powderfinger started recording their sixth studio album, Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , in January 2007; it was released on 2 June  Debuting at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart – their fourth to do so consecutively – it broke the Australian digital sales record with over 3,000 copies sold online  In general, reviewers did not rate it as highly as its predecessor Vulture Street , with Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun HiT describing it as No radical reinvention, no huge change in direction ... In a word: consistent  Zuel described it as Powderfinger's first dull album but the band as the biggest rock band in the country   Lost and Running , their first single for three years, had been issued in May, and reached No  5. A second single,  I Don't Remember , appeared in August  One song from the album,  Black Tears , was amended following concerns that it could prejudice a trial over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  Fanning stated that an alternative version would be on the album as a result of the concerns  On 18 August that year, Powderfinger performed a concert in Karratha as part of Triple J's AWOL Series  The band was supported by The Grates and Muph N Plutonic, and various local acts  While in Karratha, Fanning and Coghill visited Gumala Mirnuwarni, a local school in Roebourne that encourages children to stay in school   In June 2007 Powderfinger and Silverchair announced the nine-week Across the Great Divide tour to promote reconciliation with Indigenous Australians . From August to October that year the two groups toured all state capital cities as well as fourteen Australian regional centres, and included four performances in New Zealand  They performed 34 concerts in 26 towns across Australia, with an estimated total of 220,000 people in attendance  On 1 December, a triple-DVD set was released with the same title as the tour , with the Melbourne performances for both bands and backstage footage from the tour  The schedule consisted of three main parts, beginning with a supporting artist performing one set, followed by Silverchair and then Powderfinger playing the final set  The two bands united on stage during only three performances throughout the tour, including Daniel Johns (Silverchair) and Fanning sharing lead vocals on a cover version of The Who 's  Substitute  at one show in Sydney and two in Melbourne   Dream Days at the Hotel Existence was the recipient of the ARIA Award for Best Cover Art in 2007 . It was also nominated for Album of the Year, Best Rock Album, and Best Group, while Lost and Running received nominations for Single of the Year and Best Video  Powderfinger failed to win any of these awards, with tour mates Silverchair's Young Modern and  Straight Lines  obtaining all five  On 28 October at the ceremony, Powderfinger performed Lost and Running  The third single from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence ,  Nobody Sees , was released in December 2007  On 27 September 2008, Powderfinger performed (Baby I've Got You) On My Mind and AC/DC 's  Long Way to the Top  at the AFL Grand Final . Their song Drifting Further Away featured on Grey's Anatomy ' s fifth season in episode 13,  Stairway to Heaven , which aired on 21 January 2009   From mid-June 2009 Powderfinger worked with DiDia producing their seventh studio album, Golden Rule , which was issued on 13 November  The album peaked at No  1 on the ARIA albums chart – becoming their fifth studio album in a row to do so  The album's lead single,  All of the Dreamers , was released in September  Burn Your Name, the second single, followed in December  That same month the band performed at the 2009 Homebake festival after a 10-year absence  In late January they toured on the 2010 Big Day Out  The third single from the album, Sail the Widest Stretch, appeared in April   Also in April 2010, Powderfinger announced that after 21 years the group would disband following their Sunsets Farewell Tour in September and October that year:  With the completion of our last album, Golden Rule , we feel that we have said all that we want to say as a musical group  We firmly believe that it is our most complete and satisfying album and can't think of a better way to farewell our fans than with music that we all believe in and also with, hopefully, our best tour to date   Coghill told Australian Times that the final tour is going to be great fun, but it's also going to be sad  He confirmed that he had no plans to start a new band or for a solo project  Instead he intended to finish his degree,  nce I'm done with that, I might put the feelers out and see what's happening  I don't think I'd be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just to have a chance to keep playing  I'm just not keen to be off touring the world anymore  Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was These Days  On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, I'm on Your Side, as a fundraiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of major flooding in Queensland from December the previous year into January  The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause  On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, Footprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 2001–2011 , containing two new tracks  There was also a 2-disc release, Fingerprints &amp; Footprints – The Ultimate Collection , combining both Fingerprints and Footprints in one set  Also in November, Dino Scatena, together with the band, published a biography, Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band . Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in October of the previous year, during the Sunsets Farewell Tour   Former Powderfinger member Bernard Fanning worked on his second solo album Departures during late 2012 in Los Angeles, with Joe Chiccarelli producing  It was released in June the following year and peaked at No  1 on the ARIA Albums Chart  Middleton had relocated to Melbourne and worked with Red Door Sounds' Paul Annison – producer of Children Collide 's album Monument (April 2012). In December that year Middleton revealed that I’m halfway through a new record  Middleton's album, Translations , was released independently in November 2013  Around the same time Coghill was working as a journalist on the Gold Coast, while Collins was developing business projects in Queensland   In January 2013 Haug produced the second album, Sins of a Li'l Later Kiss , by Brisbane-based folk duo Cole and Van Dijk  He then joined the Church , replacing Marty Willson-Piper , and featured on their 2014 album Further/Deeper .  On the 23 May 2020, Powderfinger reformed for a one off, live-streamed YouTube charity performance titled, One Night Lonely with all proceeds going to Beyond Blue and Support Act  On 25 May, an EP of the performance was released   On 31 August 2020, Powderfinger confirmed the release of a compilation album of unreleased songs titled Unreleased (1998–2010) due on the 27th November 2020, which was preceded by the single Day by Day, released on 18 September   On 13 November 2020, Powderfinger released the second single preceding the release of the album Unreleased (1998-2010) Daybreak   Powderfinger's musical style includes hard rock and alternative music and, according to McFarlane, the band made its mark with an earthy, blues-based sound that combined soaring, 1970s-influenced riff-rock with 1990s studio technology  With the added textures of folk, country and a soulful groove, the band was able to head in any direction  Nimmervoll acclaimed them as one of Australia's most popular radio-friendly rock bands which produced music the rest of Australia embraced  McFarlane was partially disappointed with their debut 1994 album Parables for Wooden Ears compared to their earlier EP Transfusion . Their 1996 album, Double Allergic , was more self-assured and textured and consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene  It revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves according to Nimmervoll   In a November 2007 interview with Paul Cashmere of the website Undercover, Middleton stated that a couple of songs they had initially written for Vulture Street were just too Odyssey Number Five based, and that the first track, Rockin' Rocks, was probably the start of where we were heading with the album  Cashmere stated that the album was the toughest heard Powderfinger sound  Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger's more recent albums, and described Vulture Street as a rawer, louder album in comparison to Odyssey Number Five ; it highlighted Fanning's talent as a lyricist and he stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut  Zuel also stated that there is a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, and described On My Mind as having  AC/DC meatiness, and Love Your Way as acoustic tumbling into weaving Zeppelin lines  In his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence , Zuel described it as  high-gloss and muscular framework, and stated that that was what American radio considers serious rock   Compared with the relatively lean, agile sound they've perfected up to now, this is Powderfinger as the footballer who in the off-season spends his time in the gym and emerges buff and beefy  The problem is he has bulk but has traded in his nimbleness   Clayton Bolger of AllMusic stated in his review of Dream Days at the Hotel Existence that Powderfinger largely revisit the sound of their Internationalist album, leaving behind much of the glam and swagger of 2003's Vulture Street . He commented on Fanning's commanding and distinctive vocals, the twin-guitar attack of Middleton and Haug, Collins' innovative basslines, and the powerhouse drum work of Coghill  Nimmervoll described Golden Rule as Powderfinger back to its essence  They’d experimented with the sound, tried different things with the songwriting process and recorded in America with different producers  was recorded at home, the band reunited with American Nick DiDia, who had previously worked with the band during the classic era, producing Internationalist , Odyssey Number 5 and Vulture Street . They also wrote the songs as a team, with Bernard responsible for the bulk of the lyrics  The album was recorded in the same spirit, as close to the live sound as a studio album could be   Powderfinger were active in supporting causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances  In 1996, when Crowded House decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the Sydney Children's Hospital on 24 November  They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts Custard and You Am I to also appear on the steps of the Sydney Opera House . The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled Farewell to the World , was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people  In the wake of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami , Powderfinger performed at the WaveAid fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005  The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area  The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected   The song  Black Tears  from the album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence originally had the lyric An island watchhouse bed, a black man's lying dead, which sparked fears that it might prejudice the trial of the former Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley over the 2004 Palm Island death in custody case  The band claimed that the song's lyrics primarily dealt with the climbing of Uluru by tourists despite requests from the Indigenous people of the area to respect their sacred sites and not climb  The original version of the song was retracted from the album, and replaced with an alternative version with the criticised material removed  The legal team for Hurley, who was charged with manslaughter over the death of Mulrunji in 2004, had referred the song to the Attorney-General of Queensland , Kerry Shine , in their attempt at altering the track  One of Hurley's lawyers, Glen Cranny, stated that the content and proposed timing of the song's release raises some serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley's trial  Powderfinger's band manager, Paul Piticco , stated that Fanning had confirmed that a line in the song was related to the case  However, he added that the lyric in question could refer to a watchhouse in The Bahamas or something   In June 2007, Powderfinger and Silverchair announced their combined Across the Great Divide Tour, which promoted Reconciliation Australia , a foundation helping to improve the welfare of the Indigenous people of Australia, and to show both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation  Reconciliation Australia increased the awareness of the 17-year difference in life expectancy between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous children of Australia  In October that year, during Breast Cancer Awareness Month , Powderfinger performed another concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House  This concert was for invitees only – breast cancer patients, survivors, and their families were eligible to attend  Powderfinger performed alongside Silverchair, Missy Higgins , and other artists to an audience of 700  The concert was filmed and later broadcast as a MAX Session on Foxtel channel MAX on 3 November   For the Sunsets Farewell Tour in September 2010, the band promoted another Indigenous cause, the Yalari organisation  The organisation provides Indigenous children with opportunities to get a proper education  In January 2011, following the Queensland flood disaster , reported that Powderfinger would not reform for a benefit concert, but the band instead donated a never-before released track, I'm on Your Side, to help raise money for the victims   Throughout their recording career, Powderfinger consisted of five members: Bernard Fanning as lead vocalist, guitarist, keyboardist, and harmonicist; John Collins as bass guitarist; Ian Haug, originally the lead vocalist until Fanning joined, played lead guitars; Darren Middleton on co-lead guitars, keyboards, backing vocals, and occasional lead vocals; Jon Coghill as drummer and percussionist  Their lineup remained stable from 1992 until their disbandment in November 2010  Steven Bishop had been the group's original drummer, but had left to focus on his studies  The band refers to one another by nicknames, including Collins as JC and Coghill as Cogsy   Powderfinger have collaborated with various artists throughout their career: Pianist Benmont Tench played on Dream Days at the Hotel Existence . For touring or session work, auxiliary musicians used include Alex Pertout on percussion, Duane Billings on percussion, and Lachlan Doley on keyboards  For their second album, Double Allergic , the group enlisted Tim Whitten as producer  The group approached American expatriate Nick DiDia as their producer for Internationalist , and recorded with him at Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne  DiDia also produced the two albums which followed  In 2007 Rob Schnapf , producer for Beck , was asked to produce Dream Days at the Hotel Existence in Los Angeles  DiDia returned for Golden Rule . Powderfinger's first music video, for the song Reap What You Sow in 1993, was directed by David Barker, an award-winning director  Film companies who directed other videos for the group include Fifty Fifty Films and Head Pictures   Powderfinger was highly successful in the Australian recording industry, being a recipient of the industry's flagship awards, the ARIA Music Awards, 18 times from 47 nominations – the third-highest behind Silverchair's 21 wins from 49 nominations and John Farnham 's 20 wins from 56 nominations  Powderfinger's most successful year was 2001 , when they won six awards from eight nominations for Odyssey Number Five and its related singles  These Days and My Happiness were ranked at No  1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 lists in 1999 and 2000 respectively, and 21 other Powderfinger tracks have ranked on lists in other years   In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Powderfinger were announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for their role as Influential Artists   General  Specific     Joseph Maurice Ravel ( French:  ; 7 March 1875 – 28 December 1937) was a French composer, pianist and conductor  He is often associated with impressionism along with his elder contemporary Claude Debussy , although both composers rejected the term  In the 1920s and 1930s Ravel was internationally regarded as France's greatest living composer   Born to a music-loving family, Ravel attended France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire ; he was not well regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal  After leaving the conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity and incorporating elements of modernism, baroque , neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz . He liked to experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition takes the place of development  He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky 's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known   A slow and painstaking worker, Ravel composed fewer pieces than many of his contemporaries  Among his works to enter the repertoire are pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concertos, ballet music, two operas and eight song cycles; he wrote no symphonies or church music  Many of his works exist in two versions: first, a piano score and later an orchestration  Some of his piano music, such as Gaspard de la nuit (1908), is exceptionally difficult to play, and his complex orchestral works such as Daphnis et Chloé (1912) require skilful balance in performance   Ravel was among the first composers to recognise the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public  From the 1920s, despite limited technique as a pianist or conductor, he took part in recordings of several of his works; others were made under his supervision   Ravel was born in the Basque town of Ciboure , France, near Biarritz , 18 kilometres (11 mi) from the Spanish border  His father, Pierre-Joseph Ravel , was an educated and successful engineer, inventor and manufacturer, born in Versoix near the Franco-Swiss border  His mother, Marie, née Delouart, was Basque but had grown up in Madrid  In 19th-century terms, Joseph had married beneath his status – Marie was illegitimate and barely literate – but the marriage was a happy one  Some of Joseph's inventions were successful, including an early internal combustion engine and a notorious circus machine, the Whirlwind of Death, an automotive loop-the-loop that was a major attraction until a fatal accident at Barnum and Bailey's Circus in 1903   Both Ravel's parents were Roman Catholics ; Marie was also something of a free-thinker , a trait inherited by her elder son  He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born  The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born  (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession ) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque-Spanish heritage was a strong influence on his life and music  Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him  The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and the two boys had happy childhoods   Ravel senior delighted in taking his sons to factories to see the latest mechanical devices, but he also had a keen interest in music and culture in general  In later life, Ravel recalled, Throughout my childhood I was sensitive to music  My father, much better educated in this art than most amateurs are, knew how to develop my taste and to stimulate my enthusiasm at an early age  There is no record that Ravel received any formal general schooling in his early years; his biographer Roger Nichols suggests that the boy may have been chiefly educated by his father   When he was seven, Ravel started piano lessons with Henry Ghys, a friend of Emmanuel Chabrier ; five years later, in 1887, he began studying harmony , counterpoint and composition with Charles-René, a pupil of Léo Delibes . Without being anything of a child prodigy, he was a highly musical boy  Charles-René found that Ravel's conception of music was natural to him and not, as in the case of so many others, the result of effort  Ravel's earliest known compositions date from this period: variations on a chorale by Schumann , variations on a theme by Grieg and a single movement of a piano sonata  They survive only in fragmentary form   In 1888 Ravel met the young pianist Ricardo Viñes , who became not only a lifelong friend, but also one of the foremost interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music  The two shared an appreciation of Wagner , Russian music, and the writings of Poe , Baudelaire and Mallarmé . At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov . This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy , as did the exotic sound of the Javanese gamelan , also heard during the Exposition   Émile Decombes took over as Ravel's piano teacher in 1889; in the same year Ravel gave his earliest public performance  Aged fourteen, he took part in a concert at the Salle Érard along with other pupils of Decombes, including Reynaldo Hahn and Alfred Cortot .  With the encouragement of his parents, Ravel applied for entry to France's most important musical college, the Conservatoire de Paris . In November 1889, playing music by Chopin , he passed the examination for admission to the preparatory piano class run by Eugène Anthiome  Ravel won the first prize in the Conservatoire's piano competition in 1891, but otherwise he did not stand out as a student  Nevertheless, these years were a time of considerable advance in his development as a composer  The musicologist Arbie Orenstein writes that for Ravel the 1890s were a period of immense growth   ... from adolescence to maturity   In 1891 Ravel progressed to the classes of Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot , for piano, and Émile Pessard , for harmony  He made solid, unspectacular progress, with particular encouragement from Bériot but, in the words of the musicologist Barbara L. Kelly , he was only teachable on his own terms  His later teacher Gabriel Fauré understood this, but it was not generally acceptable to the conservative faculty of the Conservatoire of the 1890s  Ravel was expelled in 1895, having won no more prizes  His earliest works to survive in full are from these student days: Sérénade grotesque , for piano, and Ballade de la Reine morte d'aimer, a mélodie setting a poem by Roland de Marès (both 1893).  Ravel was never so assiduous a student of the piano as his colleagues such as Viñes and Cortot were  It was plain that as a pianist he would never match them, and his overriding ambition was to be a composer  From this point he concentrated on composition  His works from the period include the songs Un grand sommeil noir and D'Anne jouant de l'espinette to words by Paul Verlaine and Clément Marot , and the piano pieces Menuet antique and Habanera (for four hands), the latter eventually incorporated into the Rapsodie espagnole . At around this time, Joseph Ravel introduced his son to Erik Satie , who was earning a living as a café pianist  Ravel was one of the first musicians – Debussy was another – who recognised Satie's originality and talent  Satie's constant experiments in musical form were an inspiration to Ravel, who counted them of inestimable value   In 1897 Ravel was readmitted to the Conservatoire, studying composition with Fauré, and taking private lessons in counterpoint with André Gedalge . Both these teachers, particularly Fauré, regarded him highly and were key influences on his development as a composer  As Ravel's course progressed, Fauré reported a distinct gain in maturity   ... engaging wealth of imagination  Ravel's standing at the Conservatoire was nevertheless undermined by the hostility of the Director, Théodore Dubois , who deplored the young man's musically and politically progressive outlook  Consequently, according to a fellow student, Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi , he was a marked man, against whom all weapons were good  He wrote some substantial works while studying with Fauré, including the overture Shéhérazade and a violin sonata, but he won no prizes, and therefore was expelled again in 1900  As a former student he was allowed to attend Fauré's classes as a non-participating auditeur until finally abandoning the Conservatoire in 1903   In 1899 Ravel composed his first piece to become widely known, though it made little impact initially: Pavane pour une infante défunte ( Pavane for a dead princess). It was originally a solo piano work, commissioned by the Princesse de Polignac . In 1897 he conducted the first performance of the Shéhérazade overture, which had a mixed reception, with boos mingling with applause from the audience, and unflattering reviews from the critics  One described the piece as a jolting debut: a clumsy plagiarism of the Russian School and called Ravel a mediocrely gifted debutant   ... who will perhaps become something if not someone in about ten years, if he works hard  Another critic, Pierre Lalo , thought that Ravel showed talent, but was too indebted to Debussy and should instead emulate Beethoven . Over the succeeding decades Lalo became Ravel's most implacable critic   From the start of his career, Ravel appeared calmly indifferent to blame or praise  Those who knew him well believed that this was no pose but wholly genuine  The only opinion of his music that he truly valued was his own, perfectionist and severely self-critical  At twenty years of age he was, in the words of the biographer Burnett James, self-possessed, a little aloof, intellectually biased, given to mild banter  He dressed like a dandy and was meticulous about his appearance and demeanour  Orenstein comments that, short in stature, light in frame and bony in features, Ravel had the appearance of a well-dressed jockey, whose large head seemed suitably matched to his formidable intellect  During the late 1890s and into the early years of the next century, Ravel was bearded in the fashion of the day; from his mid-thirties he was clean-shaven   Around 1900 Ravel and a number of innovative young artists, poets, critics and musicians joined together in an informal group; they came to be known as Les Apaches (The Hooligans), a name coined by Viñes to represent their status as artistic outcasts  They met regularly until the beginning of the First World War, and members stimulated one another with intellectual argument and performances of their works  The membership of the group was fluid, and at various times included Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla as well as their French friends   Among the enthusiasms of the Apaches was the music of Debussy  Ravel, twelve years his junior, had known Debussy slightly since the 1890s, and their friendship, though never close, continued for more than ten years  In 1902 André Messager conducted the premiere of Debussy's opera Pelléas et Mélisande at the Opéra-Comique . It divided musical opinion  Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend, and the conductor's friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Saëns was prominent among those who detested the piece  The Apaches were loud in their support  The first run of the opera consisted of fourteen performances: Ravel attended all of them   Debussy was widely held to be an impressionist composer – a label he intensely disliked  Many music lovers began to apply the same term to Ravel, and the works of the two composers were frequently taken as part of a single genre  Ravel thought that Debussy was indeed an impressionist but that he himself was not  Orenstein comments that Debussy was more spontaneous and casual in his composing while Ravel was more attentive to form and craftsmanship  Ravel wrote that Debussy's genius was obviously one of great individuality, creating its own laws, constantly in evolution, expressing itself freely, yet always faithful to French tradition  For Debussy, the musician and the man, I have had profound admiration, but by nature I am different from Debussy   ... I think I have always personally followed a direction opposed to that of symbolism . During the first years of the new century Ravel's new works included the piano piece Jeux d'eau (1901), the String Quartet and the orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade (both 1903). Commentators have noted some Debussian touches in some parts of these works  Nichols calls the quartet at once homage to and exorcism of Debussy's influence   The two composers ceased to be on friendly terms in the middle of the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons  Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other  Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom  Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people  The public tension led to personal estrangement  Ravel said, It's probably better for us, after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons  Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift  In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer Emma Bardac . Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante Misia Edwards and the opera star Lucienne Bréval , contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband    During the first years of the new century Ravel made five attempts to win France's most prestigious prize for young composers, the Prix de Rome , past winners of which included Berlioz , Gounod , Bizet , Massenet and Debussy  In 1900 Ravel was eliminated in the first round; in 1901 he won the second prize for the competition  In 1902 and 1903 he won nothing: according to the musicologist Paul Landormy , the judges suspected Ravel of making fun of them by submitting cantatas so academic as to seem like parodies  In 1905 Ravel, by now thirty, competed for the last time, inadvertently causing a furore . He was eliminated in the first round, which even critics unsympathetic to his music, including Lalo, denounced as unjustifiable  The press's indignation grew when it emerged that the senior professor at the Conservatoire, Charles Lenepveu , was on the jury, and only his students were selected for the final round; his insistence that this was pure coincidence was not well received  L'affaire Ravel became a national scandal, leading to the early retirement of Dubois and his replacement by Fauré, appointed by the government to carry out a radical reorganisation of the Conservatoire   Among those taking a close interest in the controversy was Alfred Edwards , owner and editor of Le Matin , for which Lalo wrote  Edwards was married to Ravel's friend Misia; the couple took Ravel on a seven-week Rhine cruise on their yacht in June and July 1905, the first time he had travelled abroad   By the latter part of the 1900s Ravel had established a pattern of writing works for piano and subsequently arranging them for full orchestra  He was in general a slow and painstaking worker, and reworking his earlier piano compositions enabled him to increase the number of pieces published and performed  There appears to have been no mercenary motive for this; Ravel was known for his indifference to financial matters  The pieces that began as piano compositions and were then given orchestral dress were Pavane pour une infante défunte (orchestrated 1910), Une barque sur l'océan (1906, from the 1905 piano suite Miroirs ), the Habanera section of Rapsodie espagnole (1907–08), Ma mère l'Oye (1908–10, orchestrated 1911), Valses nobles et sentimentales (1911, orchestrated 1912), Alborada del gracioso (from Miroirs , orchestrated 1918) and Le tombeau de Couperin (1914–17, orchestrated 1919).  Ravel was not by inclination a teacher, but he gave lessons to a few young musicians he felt could benefit from them  Manuel Rosenthal was one, and records that Ravel was a very demanding teacher when he thought his pupil had talent  Like his own teacher, Fauré, he was concerned that his pupils should find their own individual voices and not be excessively influenced by established masters  He warned Rosenthal that it was impossible to learn from studying Debussy's music: Only Debussy could have written it and made it sound like only Debussy can sound  When George Gershwin asked him for lessons in the 1920s, Ravel, after serious consideration, refused, on the grounds that they would probably cause him to write bad Ravel and lose his great gift of melody and spontaneity  The best known composer who studied with Ravel was probably Ralph Vaughan Williams , who was his pupil for three months in 1907–08  Vaughan Williams recalled that Ravel helped him escape from the heavy contrapuntal Teutonic manner   ... Complexe mais pas compliqué was his motto   Vaughan Williams's recollections throw some light on Ravel's private life, about which the latter's reserved and secretive personality has led to much speculation  Vaughan Williams, Rosenthal and Marguerite Long have all recorded that Ravel frequented brothels, Long attributed this to his self-consciousness about his diminutive stature, and consequent lack of confidence with women  By other accounts, none of them first-hand, Ravel was in love with Misia Edwards, or wanted to marry the violinist Hélène Jourdan-Morhange . Rosenthal records and discounts contemporary speculation that Ravel, a lifelong bachelor, may have been homosexual  Such speculation recurred in a 2000 life of Ravel by Benjamin Ivry ; subsequent studies have concluded that Ravel's sexuality and personal life remain a mystery   Ravel's first concert outside France was in 1909  As the guest of the Vaughan Williamses, he visited London, where he played for the Société des Concerts Français, gaining favourable reviews and enhancing his growing international reputation   The Société Nationale de Musique , founded in 1871 to promote the music of rising French composers, had been dominated since the mid-1880s by a conservative faction led by Vincent d'Indy . Ravel, together with several other former pupils of Fauré, set up a new, modernist organisation, the Société Musicale Indépendente, with Fauré as its president  The new society's inaugural concert took place on 20 April 1910; the seven items on the programme included premieres of Fauré's song cycle La chanson d'Ève , Debussy's piano suite D'un cahier d'esquisses , Zoltán Kodály 's Six pièces pour piano and the original piano duet version of Ravel's Ma mère l'Oye . The performers included Fauré, Florent Schmitt , Ernest Bloch , Pierre Monteux and, in the Debussy work, Ravel  Kelly considers it a sign of Ravel's new influence that the society featured Satie's music in a concert in January 1911   The first of Ravel's two operas, the one-act comedy L'heure espagnole was premiered in 1911  The work had been completed in 1907, but the manager of the Opéra-Comique, Albert Carré , repeatedly deferred its presentation  He was concerned that its plot – a bedroom farce – would be badly received by the ultra-respectable mothers and daughters who were an important part of the Opéra-Comique's audience  The piece was only modestly successful at its first production, and it was not until the 1920s that it became popular   In 1912 Ravel had three ballets premiered  The first, to the orchestrated and expanded version of Ma mère l'Oye , opened at the Théâtre des Arts in January  The reviews were excellent: the Mercure de France called the score absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature  The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the Queen's Hall , London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year  The Times praised the enchantment of the work   ... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing  New York audiences heard the work in the same year  Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was Adélaïde ou le langage des fleurs , danced to the score of Valses nobles et sentimentales , which opened at the Châtelet in April  Daphnis et Chloé opened at the same theatre in June  This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete   Daphnis et Chloé was commissioned in or about 1909 by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his company, the Ballets Russes . Ravel began work with Diaghilev's choreographer, Michel Fokine , and designer, Léon Bakst . Fokine had a reputation for his modern approach to dance, with individual numbers replaced by continuous music  This appealed to Ravel, and after discussing the action in great detail with Fokine, Ravel began composing the music  There were frequent disagreements between the collaborators, and the premiere was under-rehearsed because of the late completion of the work  It had an unenthusiastic reception and was quickly withdrawn, although it was revived successfully a year later in Monte Carlo and London  The effort to complete the ballet took its toll on Ravel's health; neurasthenia obliged him to rest for several months after the premiere   Ravel composed little during 1913  He collaborated with Stravinsky on a performing version of Mussorgsky 's unfinished opera Khovanshchina , and his own works were the Trois poèmes de Mallarmé for soprano and chamber ensemble, and two short piano pieces, À la manière de Borodine and À la manière de Chabrier . In 1913, together with Debussy, Ravel was among the musicians present at the dress rehearsal of The Rite of Spring . Stravinsky later said that Ravel was the only person who immediately understood the music  Ravel predicted that the premiere of the Rite would be seen as an event of historic importance equal to that of Pelléas et Mélisande .  When Germany invaded France in 1914 Ravel tried to join the French Air Force . He considered his small stature and light weight ideal for an aviator, but was rejected because of his age and a minor heart complaint  While waiting to be enlisted, Ravel composed Trois Chansons , his only work for a cappella choir, setting his own texts in the tradition of French 16th-century chansons  He dedicated the three songs to people who might help him to enlist  After several unsuccessful attempts to enlist, Ravel finally joined the Thirteenth Artillery Regiment as a lorry driver in March 1915, when he was forty  Stravinsky expressed admiration for his friend's courage: at his age and with his name he could have had an easier place, or done nothing  Some of Ravel's duties put him in mortal danger, driving munitions at night under heavy German bombardment  At the same time his peace of mind was undermined by his mother's failing health  His own health also deteriorated; he suffered from insomnia and digestive problems, underwent a bowel operation following amoebic dysentery in September 1916, and had frostbite in his feet the following winter   During the war, the Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Française was formed by Saint-Saëns, Dubois, d'Indy and others, campaigning for a ban on the performance of contemporary German music  Ravel declined to join, telling the committee of the league in 1916, It would be dangerous for French composers to ignore systematically the productions of their foreign colleagues, and thus form themselves into a sort of national coterie: our musical art, which is so rich at the present time, would soon degenerate, becoming isolated in banal formulas  The league responded by banning Ravel's music from its concerts   Ravel's mother died in January 1917, and he fell into a horrible despair, compounding the distress he felt at the suffering endured by the people of his country during the war  He composed few works in the war years  The Piano Trio was almost complete when the conflict began, and the most substantial of his wartime works is Le tombeau de Couperin , composed between 1914 and 1917  The suite celebrates the tradition of François Couperin , the 18th-century French composer; each movement is dedicated to a friend of Ravel's who died in the war   After the war, those close to Ravel recognised that he had lost much of his physical and mental stamina  As the musicologist Stephen Zank puts it, Ravel's emotional equilibrium, so hard won in the previous decade, had been seriously compromised  His output, never large, became smaller  Nonetheless, after the death of Debussy in 1918, he was generally seen, in France and abroad, as the leading French composer of the era  Fauré wrote to him, I am happier than you can imagine about the solid position which you occupy and which you have acquired so brilliantly and so rapidly  It is a source of joy and pride for your old professor  Ravel was offered the Legion of Honour in 1920, and although he declined the decoration, he was viewed by the new generation of composers typified by Satie's protégés Les Six as an establishment figure  Satie had turned against him, and commented, Ravel refuses the Légion d'honneur, but all his music accepts it  Despite this attack, Ravel continued to admire Satie's early music, and always acknowledged the older man's influence on his own development  Ravel took a benign view of Les Six, promoting their music, and defending it against journalistic attacks  He regarded their reaction against his works as natural, and preferable to their copying his style  Through the Société Musicale Indépendente, he was able to encourage them and composers from other countries  The Société presented concerts of recent works by American composers including Aaron Copland , Virgil Thomson and George Antheil and by Vaughan Williams and his English colleagues Arnold Bax and Cyril Scott .  Orenstein and Zank both comment that, although Ravel's post-war output was small, averaging only one composition a year, it included some of his finest works  In 1920 he completed La valse , in response to a commission from Diaghilev  He had worked on it intermittently for some years, planning a concert piece, a sort of apotheosis of the Viennese waltz, mingled with, in my mind, the impression of a fantastic, fatal whirling  It was rejected by Diaghilev, who said, It's a masterpiece, but it's not a ballet  It's the portrait of a ballet  Ravel heard Diaghilev's verdict without protest or argument, left, and had no further dealings with him  Nichols comments that Ravel had the satisfaction of seeing the ballet staged twice by other managements before Diaghilev died  A ballet danced to the orchestral version of Le tombeau de Couperin was given at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in November 1920, and the premiere of La valse followed in December  The following year Daphnis et Chloé and L'heure espagnole were successfully revived at the Paris Opéra   In the post-war era there was a reaction against the large-scale music of composers such as Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss . Stravinsky, whose Rite of Spring was written for a huge orchestra, began to work on a much smaller scale  His 1923 ballet score Les noces is composed for voices and twenty-one instruments  Ravel did not like the work (his opinion caused a cooling in Stravinsky's friendship with him) but he was in sympathy with the fashion for dépouillement – the stripping away of pre-war extravagance to reveal the essentials  Many of his works from the 1920s are noticeably sparer in texture than earlier pieces  Other influences on him in this period were jazz and atonality . Jazz was popular in Parisian cafés, and French composers such as Darius Milhaud incorporated elements of it in their work  Ravel commented that he preferred jazz to grand opera , and its influence is heard in his later music  Arnold Schönberg 's abandonment of conventional tonality also had echoes in some of Ravel's music such as the Chansons madécasses (1926), which Ravel doubted he could have written without the example of Pierrot Lunaire . His other major works from the 1920s include the orchestral arrangement of Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition (1922), the opera L'enfant et les sortilèges to a libretto by Colette (1926), Tzigane (1924) and the Violin Sonata (1927).  Finding city life fatiguing, Ravel moved to the countryside  In May 1921 he took up residence at Le Belvédère, a small house on the fringe of Montfort-l'Amaury , 50 kilometres (31 mi) west of Paris, in the Yvelines département . Looked after by a devoted housekeeper, Mme Revelot, he lived there for the rest of his life  At Le Belvédère Ravel composed and gardened, when not performing in Paris or abroad  His touring schedule increased considerably in the 1920s, with concerts in Britain, Sweden, Denmark, the US, Canada, Spain, Austria and Italy   Arbie Orenstein  After two months of planning, Ravel made a four-month tour of North America in 1928, playing and conducting  His fee was a guaranteed minimum of $ 10,000 and a constant supply of Gauloises cigarettes  He appeared with most of the leading orchestras in Canada and the US and visited twenty-five cities  Audiences were enthusiastic and the critics were complimentary  At an all-Ravel programme conducted by Serge Koussevitzky in New York, the entire audience stood up and applauded as the composer took his seat  Ravel was touched by this spontaneous gesture and observed, You know, this doesn't happen to me in Paris  Orenstein, commenting that this tour marked the zenith of Ravel's international reputation, lists its non-musical highlights as a visit to Poe's house in New York, and excursions to Niagara Falls and the Grand Canyon . Ravel was unmoved by his new international celebrity  He commented that the critics' recent enthusiasm was of no more importance than their earlier judgment, when they called him the most perfect example of insensitivity and lack of emotion   The last composition Ravel completed in the 1920s, Boléro , became his most famous  He was commissioned to provide a score for Ida Rubinstein 's ballet company, and having been unable to secure the rights to orchestrate Albéniz 's Iberia , he decided on an experiment in a very special and limited direction   ... a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of orchestral tissue without music  Ravel continued that the work was one long, very gradual crescendo  There are no contrasts, and there is practically no invention except the plan and the manner of the execution  The themes are altogether impersonal  He was astonished, and not wholly pleased, that it became a mass success  When one elderly member of the audience at the Opéra shouted Rubbish  at the premiere, he remarked, That old lady got the message  The work was popularised by the conductor Arturo Toscanini , and has been recorded several hundred times  Ravel commented to Arthur Honegger , one of Les Six, I've written only one masterpiece – Boléro . Unfortunately there's no music in it   At the beginning of the 1930s Ravel was working on two piano concertos  He completed the Piano Concerto in D major for the Left Hand first  It was commissioned by the Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein , who had lost his right arm during the war  Ravel was stimulated by the technical challenges of the project: In a work of this kind, it is essential to give the impression of a texture no thinner than that of a part written for both hands  Ravel, not proficient enough to perform the work with only his left hand, demonstrated it with both hands  Wittgenstein was initially disappointed by the piece, but after long study he became fascinated by it and ranked it as a great work  In January 1932 he premiered it in Vienna to instant acclaim, and performed it in Paris with Ravel conducting the following year  The critic Henry Prunières wrote, From the opening measures, we are plunged into a world in which Ravel has but rarely introduced us   The Piano Concerto in G major was completed a year later  After the premiere in January 1932 there was high praise for the soloist, Marguerite Long, and for Ravel's score, though not for his conducting  Long, the dedicatee, played the concerto in more than twenty European cities, with the composer conducting; they planned to record it together, but at the sessions Ravel confined himself to supervising proceedings and Pedro de Freitas Branco conducted   Igor Stravinsky  In October 1932 Ravel suffered a blow to the head in a taxi accident  The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition  As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia . Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score  Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée . The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription  Ravel composed no more after this  The exact nature of his illness is unknown  Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour , and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia , Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease . Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months  Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head   In 1937 Ravel began to suffer pain from his condition, and was examined by Clovis Vincent , a well-known Paris neurosurgeon  Vincent advised surgical treatment  He thought a tumour unlikely, and expected to find ventricular dilatation that surgery might prevent from progressing  Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view  After the operation there seemed to be an improvement in his condition, but it was short-lived, and he soon lapsed into a coma  He died on 28 December, at the age of 62   On 30 December 1937 Ravel was interred next to his parents in a granite tomb at Levallois-Perret cemetery , in north-west Paris  He was an atheist and there was no religious ceremony   Marcel Marnat 's catalogue of Ravel's complete works lists eighty-five works, including many incomplete or abandoned  Though that total is small in comparison with the output of his major contemporaries, it is nevertheless inflated by Ravel's frequent practice of writing works for piano and later rewriting them as independent pieces for orchestra  The performable body of works numbers about sixty; slightly more than half are instrumental  Ravel's music includes pieces for piano, chamber music, two piano concerti, ballet music, opera and song cycles  He wrote no symphonies or church works   Ravel drew on many generations of French composers from Couperin and Rameau to Fauré and the more recent innovations of Satie and Debussy  Foreign influences include Mozart, Schubert , Liszt and Chopin  He considered himself in many ways a classicist , often using traditional structures and forms, such as the ternary , to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies  The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata   Ravel to Vaughan Williams  Ravel placed high importance on melody, telling Vaughan Williams that there is an implied melodic outline in all vital music  His themes are frequently modal instead of using the familiar major or minor scales  As a result, there are few leading notes in his output  Chords of the ninth and eleventh and unresolved appoggiaturas , such as those in the Valses nobles et sentimentales , are characteristic of Ravel's harmonic language   Dance forms appealed to Ravel, most famously the bolero and pavane, but also the minuet , forlane , rigaudon , waltz , czardas , habanera and passacaglia . National and regional consciousness was important to him, and although a planned concerto on Basque themes never materialised, his works include allusions to Hebraic , Greek , Hungarian and gypsy themes  He wrote several short pieces paying tribute to composers he admired – Borodin , Chabrier, Fauré and Haydn , interpreting their characteristics in a Ravellian style  Another important influence was literary rather than musical: Ravel said that he learnt from Poe that true art is a perfect balance between pure intellect and emotion, with the corollary that a piece of music should be a perfectly balanced entity with no irrelevant material allowed to intrude   Ravel completed two operas, and worked on three others  The unrealised three were Olympia , La cloche engloutie and Jeanne d'Arc . Olympia was to be based on Hoffmann 's The Sandman ; he made sketches for it in 1898–99, but did not progress far  La cloche engloutie after Hauptmann 's The Sunken Bell occupied him intermittently from 1906 to 1912, Ravel destroyed the sketches for both these works, except for a Symphonie horlogère which he incorporated into the opening of L'heure espagnole . The third unrealised project was an operatic version of Joseph Delteil 's 1925 novel about Joan of Arc . It was to be a large-scale, full-length work for the Paris Opéra, but Ravel's final illness prevented him from writing it   Ravel's first completed opera was L'heure espagnole (premiered in 1911), described as a comédie musicale  It is among the works set in or illustrating Spain that Ravel wrote throughout his career  Nichols comments that the essential Spanish colouring gave Ravel a reason for virtuoso use of the modern orchestra, which the composer considered perfectly designed for underlining and exaggerating comic effects  Edward Burlingame Hill found Ravel's vocal writing particularly skilful in the work, giving the singers something besides recitative without hampering the action, and commenting orchestrally upon the dramatic situations and the sentiments of the actors without diverting attention from the stage  Some find the characters artificial and the piece lacking in humanity  The critic David Murray writes that the score glows with the famous Ravel tendresse .  The second opera, also in one act, is L'enfant et les sortilèges (1926), a fantaisie lyrique to a libretto by Colette  She and Ravel had planned the story as a ballet, but at the composer's suggestion Colette turned it into an opera libretto  It is more uncompromisingly modern in its musical style than L'heure espagnole , and the jazz elements and bitonality of much of the work upset many Parisian opera-goers  Ravel was once again accused of artificiality and lack of human emotion, but Nichols finds profoundly serious feeling at the heart of this vivid and entertaining work  The score presents an impression of simplicity, disguising intricate links between themes, with, in Murray's phrase, extraordinary and bewitching sounds from the orchestra pit throughout   Although one-act operas are generally staged less often than full-length ones, Ravel's are produced regularly in France and abroad   A substantial proportion of Ravel's output was vocal  His early works in that sphere include cantatas written for his unsuccessful attempts at the Prix de Rome  His other vocal music from that period shows Debussy's influence, in what Kelly describes as a static, recitative-like vocal style, prominent piano parts and rhythmic flexibility  By 1906 Ravel was taking even further than Debussy the natural, sometimes colloquial, setting of the French language in Histoires naturelles . The same technique is highlighted in Trois poèmes de Mallarmé (1913); Debussy set two of the three poems at the same time as Ravel, and the former's word-setting is noticeably more formal than the latter's, in which syllables are often elided  In the cycles Shéhérazade and Chansons madécasses , Ravel gives vent to his taste for the exotic, even the sensual, in both the vocal line and the accompaniment   Ravel's songs often draw on vernacular styles, using elements of many folk traditions in such works as Cinq mélodies populaires grecques , Deux mélodies hébraïques and Chants populaires . Among the poets on whose lyrics he drew were Marot, Léon-Paul Fargue , Leconte de Lisle and Verlaine  For three songs dating from 1914–15, he wrote his own texts   Although Ravel wrote for mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and mezzo-soprano voices  Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, and he seems to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade , to be sung by a woman, although a tenor voice is a permitted alternative in the score   During his lifetime it was above all as a master of orchestration that Ravel was famous  He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use  The critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote, In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one man in the world who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a pp tam-tam in the relationships of one orchestral group to another   For all Ravel's orchestral mastery, only four of his works were conceived as concert works for symphony orchestra: Rapsodie espagnole , La valse and the two concertos  All the other orchestral works were written either for the stage, as in Daphnis et Chloé , or as a reworking of piano pieces, Alborada del gracioso and Une barque sur l'ocean , ( Miroirs ), Valses nobles et sentimentales, Ma mère l'Oye , Tzigane (originally for violin and piano) and Le tombeau de Couperin  In the orchestral versions, the instrumentation generally clarifies the harmonic language of the score and brings sharpness to classical dance rhythms  Occasionally, as in the Alborada del gracioso , critics have found the later orchestral version less persuasive than the sharp-edged piano original   In some of his scores from the 1920s, including Daphnis et Chloé , Ravel frequently divides his upper strings, having them play in six to eight parts while the woodwind are required to play with extreme agility  His writing for the brass ranges from softly muted to triple-forte outbursts at climactic points  In the 1930s he tended to simplify his orchestral textures  The lighter tone of the G major Piano Concerto follows the models of Mozart and Saint-Saëns, alongside use of jazz-like themes  The critics Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor comment that in the slow movement, one of the most beautiful tunes Ravel ever invented, the composer can truly be said to join hands with Mozart  The most popular of Ravel's orchestral works, Boléro (1928), was conceived several years before its completion; in 1924 he said that he was contemplating a symphonic poem without a subject, where the whole interest will be in the rhythm   Ravel made orchestral versions of piano works by Schumann, Chabrier, Debussy and Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition . Orchestral versions of the last by Mikhail Tushmalov , Sir Henry Wood and Leo Funtek predated Ravel's 1922 version, and many more have been made since, but Ravel's remains the best known  Kelly remarks on its dazzling array of instrumental colour, and a contemporary reviewer commented on how, in dealing with another composer's music, Ravel had produced an orchestral sound wholly unlike his own   Although Ravel wrote fewer than thirty works for the piano, they exemplify his range; Orenstein remarks that the composer keeps his personal touch from the striking simplicity of Ma mère l'Oye to the transcendental virtuosity of Gaspard de la nuit . Ravel's earliest major work for piano, Jeux d'eau (1901), is frequently cited as evidence that he evolved his style independently of Debussy, whose major works for piano all came later  When writing for solo piano, Ravel rarely aimed at the intimate chamber effect characteristic of Debussy, but sought a Lisztian virtuosity  The authors of The Record Guide consider that works such as Gaspard de la Nuit and Miroirs have a beauty and originality with a deeper inspiration in the harmonic and melodic genius of Ravel himself   Most of Ravel's piano music is extremely difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges  Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing  It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour and the sort of lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in Alborada del gracioso   ... and the two outer movements of Gaspard de la nuit . Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale  This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in Gaspard de la nuit , Le gibet would bore the audience to death  Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing   Ravel's regard for his predecessors is heard in several of his piano works; Menuet sur le nom de Haydn (1909), À la manière de Borodine (1912), À la manière de Chabrier (1913) and Le tombeau de Couperin all incorporate elements of the named composers interpreted in a characteristically Ravellian manner  Clark comments that those piano works which Ravel later orchestrated are overshadowed by the revised versions: Listen to Le tombeau de Couperin and the complete ballet music for Ma mère L'Oye in the classic recordings conducted by André Cluytens , and the piano versions never sound quite the same again   Apart from a one-movement sonata for violin and piano dating from 1899, unpublished in the composer's lifetime, Ravel wrote seven chamber works  The earliest is the String Quartet (1902–03), dedicated to Fauré, and showing the influence of Debussy's quartet of ten years earlier  Like the Debussy, it differs from the more monumental quartets of the established French school of Franck and his followers, with more succinct melodies, fluently interchanged, in flexible tempos and varieties of instrumental colour  The Introduction and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet and string quartet (1905) was composed very quickly by Ravel's standards  It is an ethereal piece in the vein of the Pavane pour une infante défunte . Ravel also worked at unusual speed on the Piano Trio (1914) to complete it before joining the French Army  It contains Basque, Baroque and far Eastern influences, and shows Ravel's growing technical skill, dealing with the difficulties of balancing the percussive piano with the sustained sound of the violin and cello, blending the two disparate elements in a musical language that is unmistakably his own, in the words of the commentator Keith Anderson   Ravel's four chamber works composed after the First World War are the Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920–22), the Berceuse sur le nom de Gabriel Fauré for violin and piano (1922), the chamber original of Tzigane for violin and piano (1924) and finally the Violin Sonata (1923–27). The two middle works are respectively an affectionate tribute to Ravel's teacher, and a virtuoso display piece for the violinist Jelly d'Arányi . The Violin and Cello Sonata is a departure from the rich textures and harmonies of the pre-war Piano Trio: the composer said that it marked a turning point in his career, with thinness of texture pushed to the extreme and harmonic charm renounced in favour of pure melody  His last chamber work, the Violin Sonata (sometimes called the Second after the posthumous publication of his student sonata), is a frequently dissonant work  Ravel said that the violin and piano are essentially incompatible instruments, and that his Sonata reveals their incompatibility  Sackville-West and Shawe-Taylor consider the post-war sonatas rather laboured and unsatisfactory, and neither work has matched the popularity of Ravel's pre-war chamber works   Ravel's interpretations of some of his piano works were captured on piano roll between 1914 and 1928, although some rolls supposedly played by him may have been made under his supervision by Robert Casadesus , a better pianist  Transfers of the rolls have been released on compact disc  In 1913 there was a gramophone recording of Jeux d'eau played by Mark Hambourg , and by the early 1920s there were discs featuring the Pavane pour une infante défunte and Ondine , and movements from the String Quartet, Le tombeau de Couperin and Ma mère l'Oye . Ravel was among the first composers who recognised the potential of recording to bring their music to a wider public, and throughout the 1920s there was a steady stream of recordings of his works, some of which featured the composer as pianist or conductor  A 1932 recording of the G major Piano Concerto was advertised as Conducted by the composer, although he had in fact supervised the sessions while a more proficient conductor took the baton  Recordings for which Ravel actually was the conductor included a Boléro in 1930, and a sound film of a 1933 performance of the D major concerto with Wittgenstein as soloist   Ravel declined not only the Légion d'honneur, but all state honours from France, refusing to let his name go forward for election to the Institut de France . He accepted foreign awards, including honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1921, the Belgian Ordre de Léopold in 1926, and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford in 1928   After Ravel's death, his brother and legatee, Edouard, turned the composer's house at Montfort-l'Amaury into a museum, leaving it substantially as Ravel had known it  As of 2018 the maison-musée de Maurice Ravel remains open for guided tours   In his later years, Edouard Ravel declared his intention to leave the bulk of the composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind  After his death in 1960, the estate passed through several hands  Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who the beneficiaries were  The British newspaper The Guardian reported in 2001 that no money from royalties had been forthcoming for the maintenance of the Ravel museum at Montfort-l'Amaury, which was in a poor state of repair      Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns ( French:  ; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era . His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (Organ) Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886).  Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten  After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri , Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine , the official church of the French Empire . After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas   As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann , Liszt and Wagner , although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition  He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers  This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six , he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death   Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years  It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré , among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel . Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius   Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin  Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris , and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice , always considered himself a true Parisian  Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption (tuberculosis) on the first anniversary of his marriage  The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil , 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris   When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson  Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano  His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty , a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner . Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training  Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young  The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart  The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel , in a programme that included Mozart 's Piano Concerto in B ♭ ( K 450), and Beethoven 's Third Piano Concerto . Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher Alexandre Pierre François Boëly . From the latter he acquired a lifelong love of the music of Bach , which was then little known in France   As a schoolboy Saint-Saëns was outstanding in many subjects  In addition to his musical prowess, he distinguished himself in the study of French literature, Latin and Greek, divinity, and mathematics  His interests included philosophy, archaeology and astronomy, of which, particularly the last, he remained a talented amateur in later life   In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire , France's foremost music academy  The director, Daniel Auber , had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative  Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist  His organ professor was François Benoist , whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam , César Franck , Charles Alkan , Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet . In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies  His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy , whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet   Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo . He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome , in 1852 but was unsuccessful  Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen , who made little mark during the rest of his career  In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile , for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize  The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).  On leaving the Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns accepted the post of organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville . The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year there were more than two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and his modest basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income  The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot , had been badly damaged in the aftermath of the French Revolution and imperfectly restored  The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered  With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E ♭ (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire . The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile   Among the musicians who were quick to spot Saint-Saëns's talent were the composers Gioachino Rossini , Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt , and the influential singer Pauline Viardot , who all encouraged him in his career  In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of La Madeleine , the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world   Although in later life he had a reputation for outspoken musical conservatism, in the 1850s Saint-Saëns supported and promoted the most modern music of the day, including that of Liszt, Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner . Unlike many French composers of his own and the next generation, Saint-Saëns, for all his enthusiasm for and knowledge of Wagner's operas, was not influenced by him in his own compositions  He commented, I admire deeply the works of Richard Wagner in spite of their bizarre character  They are superior and powerful, and that is sufficient for me  But I am not, I have never been, and I shall never be of the Wagnerian religion   In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France  Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies  He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner  His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré , recalled in old age:  After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known  ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I had for him, throughout my life   Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager ). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals , with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school   In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome  Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer  He was once more unsuccessful  Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote:  We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy  We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing  I confess I was sorry to vote against a man who is truly a great artist and one who is already well known, practically a celebrity  But the other man, who is still a student, has that inner fire, inspiration, he feels, he can do things that can't be learnt and the rest he'll learn more or less  So I voted for him, sighing at the thought of the unhappiness that this failure must cause Saint-Saëns  But, whatever else, one must be honest   According to the musical scholar Jean Gallois, it was apropos of this episode that Berlioz made his well-known bon mot about Saint-Saëns, He knows everything, but lacks inexperience (Il sait tout, mais il manque d'inexpérience). The winner, Victor Sieg , had a career no more notable than that of the 1852 winner, but Saint-Saëns's biographer Brian Rees speculates that the judges may have been seeking signs of genius in the midst of tentative effort and error, and considered that Saint-Saëns had reached his summit of proficiency  The suggestion that Saint-Saëns was more proficient than inspired dogged his career and posthumous reputation  He himself wrote, Art is intended to create beauty and character  Feeling only comes afterwards and art can very well do without it  In fact, it is very much better off when it does  The biographer Jessica Duchen writes that he was a troubled man who preferred not to betray the darker side of his soul  The critic and composer Jeremy Nicholas observes that this reticence has led many to underrate the music; he quotes such slighting remarks as Saint-Saëns is the only great composer who wasn't a genius, and Bad music well written   While teaching at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of his energy into composing and performing, but after he left in 1865 he pursued both aspects of his career with vigour  In 1867 his cantata Les noces de Prométhée beat more than a hundred other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi . In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his Second Piano Concerto . Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s   In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine , professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music  Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out  Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war  During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871  With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals  Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society  The Société Nationale de Musique , with its motto, Ars Gallica , had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc , Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members   As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems , Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first poème symphonique was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872  In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged  La princesse jaune (The Yellow Princess), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique , Paris in June  It ran for five performances   Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother  In 1875, he surprised many by marrying  The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils  The marriage was not a success  In the words of the biographer Sabina Teller Ratner, Saint-Saëns's mother disapproved, and her son was difficult to live with  Saint-Saëns and his wife moved to the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince , in the Latin Quarter ; his mother moved with them  The couple had two sons, both of whom died in infancy  In 1878, the elder, André, aged two, fell from a window of the flat and was killed; the younger, Jean-François, died of pneumonia six weeks later, aged six months  Saint-Saëns and Marie-Laure continued to live together for three years, but he blamed her for André's accident; the double blow of their loss effectively destroyed the marriage   For a French composer of the 19th century, opera was seen as the most important type of music  Saint-Saëns's younger contemporary and rival, Massenet, was beginning to gain a reputation as an operatic composer, but Saint-Saëns, with only the short and unsuccessful La princesse jaune staged, had made no mark in that sphere  In February 1877, he finally had a full-length opera staged  His four-act drame lyricque, Le timbre d'argent (The Silver Bell), to Jules Barbier 's and Michel Carré 's libretto, reminiscent of the Faust legend, had been in rehearsal in 1870, but the outbreak of war halted the production  The work was eventually presented by the Théâtre Lyrique company of Paris; it ran for eighteen performances   The dedicatee of the opera, Albert Libon, died three months after the premiere, leaving Saint-Saëns a large legacy To free him from the slavery of the organ of the Madeleine and to enable him to devote himself entirely to composition  Saint-Saëns, unaware of the imminent bequest, had resigned his position shortly before his friend died  He was not a conventional Christian, and found religious dogma increasingly irksome; he had become tired of the clerical authorities' interference and musical insensitivity; and he wanted to be free to accept more engagements as a piano soloist in other cities  After this he never played the organ professionally in a church service, and rarely played the instrument at all  He composed a Messe de Requiem in memory of his friend, which was performed at Saint-Sulpice to mark the first anniversary of Libon's death; Charles-Marie Widor played the organ and Saint-Saëns conducted   In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a more solid operatic success, with Samson et Dalila , his one opera to gain and keep a place in the international repertoire  Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at Weimar in a German translation  Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892   Saint-Saëns was a keen traveller  From the 1870s until the end of his life he made 179 trips to 27 countries  His professional engagements took him most often to Germany and England; for holidays, and to avoid Parisian winters which affected his weak chest, he favoured Algiers and various places in Egypt   Saint-Saëns was elected to the Institut de France in 1881, at his second attempt, having to his chagrin been beaten by Massenet in 1878  In July of that year he and his wife went to the Auvergnat spa town of La Bourboule for a holiday  On 28 July he disappeared from their hotel, and a few days later his wife received a letter from him to say that he would not be returning  They never saw each other again  Marie Saint-Saëns returned to her family, and lived until 1950, dying near Bordeaux at the age of ninety-five  Saint-Saëns did not divorce his wife and remarry, nor did he form any later intimate relationship with a woman  Rees comments that although there is no firm evidence, some biographers believe that Saint-Saëns was more attracted to his own sex than to women  After the death of his children and collapse of his marriage, Saint-Saëns increasingly found a surrogate family in Fauré and his wife, Marie, and their two sons, to whom he was a much-loved honorary uncle  Marie told him, For us you are one of the family, and we mention your name ceaselessly here   In the 1880s Saint-Saëns continued to seek success in the opera house, an undertaking made the more difficult by an entrenched belief among influential members of the musical establishment that it was unthinkable that a pianist, organist and symphonist could write a good opera  He had two operas staged during the decade, the first being Henry VIII (1883) commissioned by the Paris Opéra  Although the libretto was not of his choosing, Saint-Saëns, normally a fluent, even facile composer, worked at the score with unusual diligence to capture a convincing air of 16th-century England  The work was a success, and was frequently revived during the composer's lifetime  When it was produced at Covent Garden in 1898, The Era commented that though French librettists generally make a pretty hash of British history, this piece was not altogether contemptible as an opera story   The open-mindedness of the Société Nationale had hardened by the mid-1880s into a dogmatic adherence to Wagnerian methods favoured by Franck's pupils, led by Vincent d'Indy . They had begun to dominate the organisation and sought to abandon its Ars Gallica ethos of commitment to French works  Bussine and Saint-Saëns found this unacceptable, and resigned in 1886  Having long pressed the merits of Wagner on a sometimes sceptical French public, Saint-Saëns was now becoming worried that the German's music was having an excessive impact on young French composers  His increasing caution towards Wagner developed in later years into stronger hostility, directed as much at Wagner's political nationalism as at his music   By the 1880s Saint-Saëns was an established favourite with audiences in England, where he was widely regarded as the greatest living French composer  In 1886 the Philharmonic Society of London commissioned what became one of his most popular and respected works, the Third (Organ) Symphony . It was premiered in London at a concert in which Saint-Saëns appeared as conductor of the symphony and as soloist in Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto , conducted by Sir Arthur Sullivan . The success of the symphony in London was considerable, but was surpassed by the ecstatic welcome the work received at its Paris premiere early the following year  Later in 1887 Saint-Saëns's drame lyrique Proserpine opened at the Opéra-Comique  It was well received and seemed to be heading for a substantial run when the theatre burnt down within weeks of the premiere and the production was lost   In December 1888 Saint-Saëns's mother died  He felt her loss deeply, and was plunged into depression and insomnia, even contemplating suicide  He left Paris and stayed in Algiers, where he recuperated until May 1889, walking and reading but unable to compose   During the 1890s Saint-Saëns spent much time on holiday, travelling overseas, composing less and performing more infrequently than before  A planned visit to perform in Chicago fell through in 1893  He wrote one opera, the comedy Phryné (1893), and together with Paul Dukas helped to complete Frédégonde (1895) an opera left unfinished by Ernest Guiraud , who died in 1892  Phryné was well received, and prompted calls for more comic operas at the Opéra-Comique, which had latterly been favouring grand opera . His few choral and orchestral works from the 1890s are mostly short; the major concert pieces from the decade were the single movement fantasia Africa (1891) and his Fifth (Egyptian) Piano Concerto , which he premiered at a concert in 1896 marking the fiftieth anniversary of his début at the Salle Pleyel in 1846  Before playing the concerto he read out a short poem he had written for the event, praising his mother's tutelage and his public's long support   Among the concerts that Saint-Saëns undertook during the decade was one at Cambridge in June 1893, when he, Bruch and Tchaikovsky performed at an event presented by Charles Villiers Stanford for the Cambridge University Musical Society , marking the award of honorary degrees to all three visitors  Saint-Saëns greatly enjoyed the visit, and even spoke approvingly of the college chapel services: The demands of English religion are not excessive  The services are very short, and consist chiefly of listening to good music extremely well sung, for the English are excellent choristers  His mutual regard for British choirs continued for the rest of his life, and one of his last large-scale works, the oratorio The Promised Land , was composed for the Three Choirs Festival of 1913   In 1900, after ten years without a permanent home in Paris, Saint-Saëns took a flat in the rue de Courcelles, not far from his old residence in the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré  This remained his home for the rest of his life  He continued to travel abroad frequently, but increasingly often to give concerts rather than as a tourist  He revisited London, where he was always a welcome visitor, went to Berlin, where until the First World War, he was greeted with honour, and travelled in Italy, Spain, Monaco and provincial France  In 1906 and 1909 he made highly successful tours of the United States, as a pianist and conductor  In New York on his second visit he premiered his Praise ye the Lord for double choir, orchestra and organ, which he composed for the occasion   Despite his growing reputation as a musical reactionary, Saint-Saëns was, according to Gallois, probably the only French musician who travelled to Munich to hear the premiere of Mahler 's Eighth Symphony in 1910  Nonetheless, by the 20th century Saint-Saëns had lost much of his enthusiasm for modernism in music  Though he strove to conceal it from Fauré, he did not understand or like the latter's opera Pénélope (1913), of which he was the dedicatee  In 1917 Francis Poulenc , at the beginning of his career as a composer, was dismissive when Ravel praised Saint-Saëns as a genius  By this time, various strands of new music were emerging with which Saint-Saëns had little in common  His classical instincts for form put him at odds with what seemed to him the shapelessness and structure of the musical impressionists, led by Debussy  Nor did the theories of Arnold Schönberg 's dodecaphony commend themselves to Saint-Saëns:  There is no longer any question of adding to the old rules new principles which are the natural expression of time and experience, but simply of casting aside all rules and every restraint  Everyone ought to make his own rules  Music is free and unlimited in its liberty of expression  There are no perfect chords, dissonant chords or false chords  All aggregations of notes are legitimate  That is called, and they believe it, the development of taste .  Holding such conservative views, Saint-Saëns was out of sympathy – and out of fashion – with the Parisian musical scene of the early 20th century, fascinated as it was with novelty  It is often said that he walked out, scandalised, from the premiere of Vaslav Nijinsky and Igor Stravinsky 's ballet The Rite of Spring in 1913  In fact, according to Stravinsky, Saint-Saëns was not present on that occasion, but at the first concert performance of the piece the following year he expressed the firm view that Stravinsky was insane   When a group of French musicians led by Saint-Saëns tried to organise a boycott of German music during the First World War, Fauré and Messager dissociated themselves from the idea, though the disagreement did not affect their friendship with their old teacher  They were privately concerned that their friend was in danger of looking foolish with his excess of patriotism, and his growing tendency to denounce in public the works of rising young composers, as in his condemnation of Debussy's En blanc et noir (1915): We must at all costs bar the door of the Institut against a man capable of such atrocities; they should be put next to the cubist pictures  His determination to block Debussy's candidacy for election to the Institut was successful, and caused bitter resentment from the younger composer's supporters  Saint-Saëns's response to the neoclassicism of Les Six was equally uncompromising: of Darius Milhaud 's polytonal symphonic suite Protée (1919) he commented, fortunately, there are still lunatic asylums in France   Saint-Saëns gave what he intended to be his farewell concert as a pianist in Paris in 1913, but his retirement was soon in abeyance as a result of the war, during which he gave many performances in France and elsewhere, raising money for war charities  These activities took him across the Atlantic, despite the danger from German warships   In November 1921, Saint-Saëns gave a recital at the Institut for a large invited audience; it was remarked that his playing was as vivid and precise as ever, and that his personal bearing was admirable for a man of eighty-six  He left Paris a month later for Algiers, with the intention of wintering there, as he had long been accustomed to do  While there, he died without warning of a heart attack on 16 December 1921  His body was taken back to Paris, and after a state funeral at the Madeleine he was buried at the cimetière du Montparnasse . Heavily veiled, in an inconspicuous place among the mourners from France's political and artistic élite, was his widow, Marie-Laure, whom he had last seen in 1881   In the early years of the 20th century, the anonymous author of the article on Saint-Saëns in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians wrote:  Saint-Saëns is a consummate master of composition, and no one possesses a more profound knowledge than he does of the secrets and resources of the art; but the creative faculty does not keep pace with the technical skill of the workman  His incomparable talent for orchestration enables him to give relief to ideas which would otherwise be crude and mediocre in themselves ... his works are on the one hand not frivolous enough to become popular in the widest sense, nor on the other do they take hold of the public by that sincerity and warmth of feeling which is so convincing   Although a keen modernist in his youth, Saint-Saëns was always deeply aware of the great masters of the past  In a profile of him written to mark his eightieth birthday, the critic D   C   Parker wrote, That Saint-Saëns knows Rameau   ... Bach and Handel , Haydn and Mozart, must be manifest to all who are familiar with his writings  His love for the classical giants and his sympathy with them form, so to speak, the foundation of his art   Less attracted than some of his French contemporaries to the continuous stream of music popularised by Wagner, Saint-Saëns often favoured self-contained melodies  Though they are frequently, in Ratner's phrase, supple and pliable, more often than not they are constructed in three- or four-bar sections, and the phrase pattern AABB is characteristic  An occasional tendency to neoclassicism, influenced by his study of French baroque music, is in contrast with the colourful orchestral music more widely identified with him  Grove observes that he makes his effects more by characterful harmony and rhythms than by extravagant scoring  In both of those areas of his craft he was normally content with the familiar  Rhythmically, he inclined to standard double, triple or compound metres (although Grove points to a 5/4 passage in the Piano Trio and another in 7/4 in the Polonaise for two pianos). From his time at the Conservatoire he was a master of counterpoint; contrapuntal passages crop up, seemingly naturally, in many of his works   The authors of the 1955 The Record Guide , Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor write that Saint-Saëns's brilliant musicianship was instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians to the fact that there are other forms of music besides opera  In the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary , Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Saëns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c.1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia  Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable  The Urbs Roma Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and thick and heavy in its effect  Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of fugal writing  The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ  It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune  The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Saëns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885). The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring motif treated in a Lisztian style of thematic transformation .  Saint-Saëns's four symphonic poems follow the model of those by Liszt, though, in Sackville-West's and Shawe-Taylor's view, without the vulgar blatancy to which the earlier composer was prone  The most popular of the four is Danse macabre (1874) depicting skeletons dancing at midnight  Saint-Saëns generally achieved his orchestral effects by deft harmonisation rather than exotic instrumentation, but in this piece he featured the xylophone prominently, representing the rattling bones of the dancers  Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871) was composed soon after the horrors of the Commune, but its lightness and delicate orchestration give no hint of recent tragedies  Rees rates Phaëton (1873) as the finest of the symphonic poems, belying the composer's professed indifference to melody, and inspired in its depiction of the mythical hero and his fate  A critic at the time of the premiere took a different view, hearing in the piece the noise of a hack coming down from Montmartre rather than the galloping fiery horses of Greek legend that inspired the piece  The last of the four symphonic poems, La jeunesse d'Hercule (Hercules's Youth, 1877) was the most ambitious of the four, which, Harding suggests, is why it is the least successful  In the judgment of the critic Roger Nichols these orchestral works, which combine striking melodies, strength of construction and memorable orchestration set new standards for French music and were an inspiration to such young composers as Ravel   Saint-Saëns wrote a one-act ballet, Javot (1896), the score for the film L'assassinat du duc de Guise (1908), and incidental music to a dozen plays between 1850 and 1916  Three of these scores were for revivals of classics by Molière and Racine, for which Saint-Saëns's deep knowledge of French baroque scores was reflected in his scores, in which he incorporated music by Lully and Charpentier .  Saint-Saëns was the first major French composer to write piano concertos  His First , in D (1858), in conventional three-movement form, is not well known, but the Second , in G minor (1868) is one of his most popular works  The composer experimented with form in this piece, replacing the customary sonata form first movement with a more discursive structure, opening with a solemn cadenza . The scherzo second movement and presto finale are in such contrast with the opening that the pianist Zygmunt Stojowski commented that the work begins like Bach and ends like Offenbach  The Third Piano Concerto , in E ♭ (1869) has another high-spirited finale, but the earlier movements are more classical, the texture clear, with graceful melodic lines  The Fourth , in C minor (1875) is probably the composer's best-known piano concerto after the Second  It is in two movements, each comprising two identifiable sub-sections, and maintains a thematic unity not found in the composer's other piano concertos  According to some sources it was this piece that so impressed Gounod that he dubbed Saint-Saëns the Beethoven of France (other sources base that distinction on the Third Symphony). The Fifth and last piano concerto, in F major, was written in 1896, more than twenty years after its predecessor  The work is known as the Egyptian concerto; it was written while the composer was wintering in Luxor , and incorporates a tune he heard Nile boatmen singing   The First Cello Concerto , in A minor (1872) is a serious although animated work, in a single continuous movement with an unusually turbulent first section  It is among the most popular concertos in the cello repertory, much favoured by Pablo Casals and later players  The Second , in D minor (1902), like the Fourth Piano Concerto, consists of two movements each subdivided into two distinct sections  It is more purely virtuosic than its predecessor: Saint-Saëns commented to Fauré that it would never be as popular as the First because it was too difficult  There are three violin concertos; the first to be composed dates from 1858 but was not published until 1879, as the composer's Second , in C major  The First, in A, was also completed in 1858  It is a short work, its single 314-bar movement lasting less than a quarter of an hour  The Second, in conventional three-movement concerto form, is twice as long as the First, and is the least popular of the three: the thematic catalogue of the composer's works lists only three performances in his lifetime  The Third , in B minor, written for Pablo de Sarasate , is technically challenging for the soloist, although the virtuoso passages are balanced by intervals of pastoral serenity  It is by some margin the most popular of the three violin concertos, but Saint-Saëns's best-known concertante work for violin and orchestra is probably the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso , in A minor, Op  28, a single-movement piece, also written for Sarasate, dating from 1863  It changes from a wistful and tense opening to a swaggering main theme, described as faintly sinister by the critic Gerald Larner, who goes on, After a multi-stopped cadenza ... the solo violin makes a breathless sprint through the coda to the happy ending in A major   Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde , Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques . During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work  The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior  In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics  Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune , which Harding describes as like Sullivan with a light French touch   Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s  In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content   ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable  Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models  From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs , which, like Massenet, he used sparingly  Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less variety of tempo within individual numbers  In a survey of recorded opera Alan Blyth writes that Saint-Saëns certainly learned much from Handel, Gluck, Berlioz, the Verdi of Aida , and Wagner, but from these excellent models he forged his own style   From the age of six and for the rest of his life Saint-Saëns composed mélodies , writing more than 140  He regarded his songs as thoroughly and typically French, denying any influence from Schubert or other German composers of Lieder . Unlike his protégé Fauré, or his rival Massenet, he was not drawn to the song cycle, writing only two during his long career – Mélodies persanes (Persian Songs, 1870) and Le Cendre rouge (The Red Ash Tree, 1914, dedicated to Fauré). The poet whose works he set most often was Victor Hugo ; others included Alphonse de Lamartine , Pierre Corneille , Amable Tastu , and, in eight songs, Saint-Saëns himself: among his many non-musical talents he was an amateur poet  He was highly sensitive to word setting, and told the young composer Lili Boulanger that to write songs effectively musical talent was not enough: you must study the French language in depth; it is indispensable  Most of the mélodies are written for piano accompaniment, but a few, including Le lever du soleil sur le Nil (Sunrise over the Nile, 1898) and Hymne à la paix (Hymn to Peace, 1919), are for voice and orchestra  His settings, and chosen verses, are generally traditional in form, contrasting with the free verse and less structured forms of a later generation of French composers, including Debussy .  Saint-Saëns composed more than sixty sacred vocal works, ranging from motets to masses and oratorios  Among the larger-scale compositions are the Requiem (1878) and the oratorios Le déluge (1875) and The Promised Land (1913) with an English text by Herman Klein . He was proud of his connection with British choirs, commenting, One likes to be appreciated in the home, par excellence , of oratorio  He wrote a smaller number of secular choral works, some for unaccompanied choir, some with piano accompaniment and some with full orchestra  In his choral works, Saint-Saëns drew heavily on tradition, feeling that his models should be Handel, Mendelssohn and other earlier masters of the genre  In Klein's view, this approach was old-fashioned, and the familiarity of Saint-Saëns's treatment of the oratorio form impeded his success in it   Nichols comments that, although as a famous pianist Saint-Saëns wrote for the piano throughout his life, this part of his oeuvre has made curiously little mark  Nichols excepts the Étude en forme de valse (1912), which he observes still attracts pianists eager to display their left-hand technique  Although Saint-Saëns was dubbed the French Beethoven, and his Variations on a Theme of Beethoven in E ♭ (1874) is his most extended work for unaccompanied piano, he did not emulate his predecessor in composing piano sonatas  He is not known even to have contemplated writing one  There are sets of bagatelles (1855), études (two sets – 1899 and 1912) and fugues (1920), but in general Saint-Saëns's works for the piano are single short pieces  In addition to established forms such as the song without words (1871) and the mazurka (1862, 1871 and 1882) popularised by Mendelssohn and Chopin, respectively, he wrote descriptive pieces such as Souvenir d'Italie (1887), Les cloches du soir (Evening bells, 1889) and Souvenir d'Ismaïlia (1895).  Unlike his pupil, Fauré, whose long career as a reluctant organist left no legacy of works for the instrument, Saint-Saëns published a modest number of pieces for organ solo  Some of them were written for use in church services – Offertoire (1853), Bénédiction nuptiale (1859), Communion (1859) and others  After he left the Madeleine in 1877 Saint-Saëns wrote ten more pieces for organ, mostly for concert use, including two sets of preludes and fugues (1894 and 1898). Some of the earlier works were written to be played on either the harmonium or the organ, and a few were primarily intended for the former   Saint-Saëns wrote more than forty chamber works between the 1840s and his last years  One of the first of his major works in the genre was the Piano Quintet (1855). It is a straightforward, confident piece, in a conventional structure with lively outer movements and a central movement containing two slow themes, one chorale-like and the other cantabile . The Septet (1880), for the unusual combination of trumpet, two violins, viola, cello, double bass and piano, is a neoclassical work that draws on 17th-century French dance forms  At the time of its composition Saint-Saëns was preparing new editions of the works of baroque composers including Rameau and Lully .  Sabina Teller Ratner, 2005  In Ratner's view, the most important of Saint-Saëns's chamber works are the sonatas: two for violin, two for cello, and one each for oboe, clarinet and bassoon, all seven with piano accompaniment  The First Violin Sonata dates from 1885, and is rated by Grove's Dictionary as one of the composer's best and most characteristic compositions  The Second (1896) signals a stylistic change in Saint-Saëns's work, with a lighter, clearer sound for the piano, characteristic of his music from then onwards  The First Cello Sonata (1872) was written after the death of the composer's great-aunt, who had taught him to play the piano more than thirty years earlier  It is a serious work, in which the main melodic material is sustained by the cello over a virtuoso piano accompaniment  Fauré called it the only cello sonata from any country to be of any importance  The Second (1905) is in four movements, and has the unusual feature of a theme and variations as its scherzo   The woodwind sonatas are among the composer's last works  Ratner writes of them, The spare, evocative, classical lines, haunting melodies, and superb formal structures underline these beacons of the neoclassical movement  Gallois comments that the Oboe Sonata begins like a conventional classical sonata, with an andantino theme; the central section has rich and colourful harmonies, and the molto allegro finale is full of delicacy, humour and charm with a form of tarantella . For Gallois the Clarinet Sonata is the most important of the three: he calls it a masterpiece full of impishness, elegance and discreet lyricism amounting to a summary of the rest  The work contrasts a doleful threnody  in the slow movement with the finale, which pirouettes in 4/4 time, in a style reminiscent of the 18th century  The same commentator calls the Bassoon Sonata a model of transparency, vitality and lightness, containing humorous touches but also moments of peaceful contemplation   The composer's most famous work, The Carnival of the Animals (1887), although far from a typical chamber piece, is written for eleven players, and is considered by Grove's Dictionary to be part of Saint-Saëns's chamber output  Grove rates it as his most brilliant comic work, parodying Offenbach, Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Rossini, his own Danse macabre and several popular tunes  He forbade performances of it during his lifetime, concerned that its frivolity would damage his reputation as a serious composer   Saint-Saëns was a pioneer in recorded music  In June 1904 The Gramophone Company of London sent its producer Fred Gaisberg to Paris to record Saint-Saëns as accompanist to the mezzo-soprano Meyriane Héglon in arias from Ascanio and Samson et Dalila , and as soloist in his own piano music, including an arrangement of sections of the Second Piano Concerto (without orchestra). Saint-Saëns made more recordings for the company in 1919   In the early days of the LP record , Saint-Saëns's works were patchily represented on disc  The Record Guide (1955) lists one recording apiece of the Third Symphony, Second Piano Concerto and First Cello Concerto, alongside several versions of Danse Macabre , The Carnival of the Animals , the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso and other short orchestral works  In the latter part of the 20th century and the early 21st, many more of the composer's works were released on LP and later CD and DVD  The 2008 Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music contains ten pages of listings of Saint-Saëns works, including all the concertos, symphonies, symphonic poems, sonatas and quartets  Also listed are an early Mass, collections of organ music, and choral songs  A recording of twenty-seven of Saint-Saëns's mélodies was released in 1997   With the exception of Samson et Dalila the operas have been sparsely represented on disc  A recording of Henry VIII was issued on CD and DVD in 1992  Hélène was released on CD in 2008  There are several recordings of Samson et Dalilah , under conductors including Sir Colin Davis , Georges Prêtre , Daniel Barenboim and Myung-Whun Chung .  Saint-Saëns was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1867 and promoted to Officier in 1884, and Grand Croix in 1913  Foreign honours included the British Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1902, and honorary doctorates from the universities of Cambridge (1893) and Oxford (1907).  In its obituary notice, The Times commented:  The death of M. Saint-Saëns not only deprives France of one of her most distinguished composers; it removes from the world the last representative of the great movements in music which were typical of the 19th century  He had maintained so vigorous a vitality and kept in such close touch with present-day activities that, though it had become customary to speak of him as the doyen of French composers, it was easy to forget the place he actually took in musical chronology  He was only two years younger than Brahms, was five years older than Tchaikovsky, six years older than Dvořák , and seven years older than Sullivan  He held a position in his own country's music certain aspects of which may be fitly compared with each of those masters in their own spheres   In a short poem, Mea culpa, published in 1890 Saint-Saëns accused himself of lack of decadence, and commented approvingly on the excessive enthusiasms of youth, lamenting that such things were not for him  An English commentator quoted the poem in 1910, observing, His sympathies are with the young in their desire to push forward, because he has not forgotten his own youth when he championed the progressive ideals of the day  The composer sought a balance between innovation and traditional form  The critic Henry Colles , wrote, a few days after the composer's death:  In his desire to maintain the perfect equilibrium we find the limitation of Saint-Saëns's appeal to the ordinary musical mind  Saint-Saëns rarely, if ever, takes any risks; he never, to use the slang of the moment, goes off the deep end  All his greatest contemporaries did  Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and even Franck, were ready to sacrifice everything for the end each wanted to reach, to drown in the attempt to get there if necessary  Saint-Saëns, in preserving his equilibrium, allows his hearers to preserve theirs   Grove concludes its article on Saint-Saëns with the observation that although his works are remarkably consistent, it cannot be said that he evolved a distinctive musical style  Rather, he defended the French tradition that threatened to be engulfed by Wagnerian influences and created the environment that nourished his successors   Since the composer's death writers sympathetic to his music have expressed regret that he is known by the musical public for only a handful of his scores such as The Carnival of the Animals , the Second Piano Concerto, the Third Violin Concerto, the Organ Symphony, Samson et Dalila , Danse macabre and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso  Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio , the ballet Javotte , the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces  In 2004, the cellist Steven Isserlis said, Saint-Saens is exactly the sort of composer who needs a festival to himself ... there are Masses, all of which are interesting  I've played all his cello music and there isn't one bad piece  His works are rewarding in every way  And he's an endlessly fascinating figure      The Sex Pistols were an English punk rock band that formed in London in 1975  Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years, they are regarded as one of the most groundbreaking acts in the history of popular music . They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians  Their fashion and hairstyles have been credited as a significant influence on punk image , and they are often associated with anarchism within music   The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten , guitarist Steve Jones , drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock . Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977  Under the management of Malcolm McLaren , the band attracted controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain  Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single  God Save the Queen , attacking Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, they precipitated the punk rock movement  It was banned not only by the BBC but also by nearly every independent radio station, making it the most heavily censored record in British history   The band's only album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols (1977)—a UK number one album—is a staple record of punk rock  In January 1978, at the end of their over-hyped and turbulent tour of the United States, Rotten announced the band's break-up  Over the next few months, the three remaining band members recorded songs for McLaren's film version of the Sex Pistols' story, The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle . Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen . Rotten, Jones, Cook and Matlock briefly reunited for a concert tour in 1996   The Sex Pistols have been recognised as an influence on various genres, including grunge , indie , thrash metal and rap . In 2004, Rolling Stone placed them No  58 on its list of the  100 Greatest Artists of All Time . On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols—the four original members plus Vicious—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , but they refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum a piss stain   The Sex Pistols evolved from The Strand, a London band formed in 1972 with working-class teenagers Steve Jones on vocals, Paul Cook on drums and Wally Nightingale on guitar  According to a later account by Jones, both he and Cook played on instruments they had stolen  Early line-ups of The Strand—sometimes known as The Swankers—also included Jim Mackin on organ and Stephen Hayes (and later, briefly, Del Noones) on bass  The band members regularly hung out at two clothing shops on the King's Road in Chelsea , London: John Krivine and Steph Raynor's Acme Attractions (where Don Letts worked as manager) and Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood 's Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die  McLaren's and Westwood's shop had opened in 1971 as Let It Rock, with a 1950s revival Teddy Boy theme  It had been renamed in 1972 to focus on another revival trend, the 50's rocker look associated with Marlon Brando . As John Lydon later observed, Malcolm and Vivienne were really a pair of shysters: they would sell anything to any trend that they could grab onto  The shop became a focal point of the punk rock scene, bringing together participants such as the future Sid Vicious , Marco Pirroni , Gene October , and Mark Stewart , among many others  Jordan , the wildly styled shop assistant, is credited with pretty well single-handedly paving the punk look   In early 1974, Jones asked McLaren to manage The Strand  Effectively agreeing, McLaren paid for their first formal rehearsal space  Glen Matlock , an art student who occasionally worked at 'Too Fast to Live, Too Young to Die', was recruited as the band's regular bassist  In November, McLaren temporarily relocated to New York City  Before his departure, McLaren and Westwood had conceived a new identity for their shop: renamed Sex , it changed its focus from retro couture to S&amp;M -inspired anti-fashion , with a billing as Specialists in rubberwear, glamourwear &amp; stagewear  After informally managing and promoting the New York Dolls for a few months, McLaren returned to London in May 1975  Inspired by the punk scene that was emerging in Lower Manhattan —in particular by the radical visual style and attitude of Richard Hell , then with Television —McLaren began taking a greater interest in The Strand members   The group had been rehearsing regularly, overseen by McLaren's friend Bernard Rhodes , and had performed publicly for the first time  Soon after McLaren's return, Nightingale was kicked out of the band and Jones, uncomfortable as frontman, took over guitar duties  According to journalist and former McLaren employee Phil Strongman, around this time the band adopted the name QT Jones and the Sex Pistols (or QT Jones &amp; His Sex Pistols, as one Rhodes-designed T-shirt put it). McLaren had been talking with the New York Dolls' Sylvain Sylvain about coming over to England to front the group  When those plans fell through, McLaren, Rhodes and the band began looking locally for a new member to assume the lead vocal duties  As described by Matlock, Everyone had long hair then, even the milkman, so what we used to do was if someone had short hair we would stop them in the street and ask them if they fancied themselves as a singer  For instance, former singer with boy band Slik and future Ultravox front man Midge Ure claims to have been approached by McLaren, but to have refused the offer  With the search going nowhere, McLaren made several calls to Richard Hell, who turned down the invitation   In August 1975, Bernard Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old King's Road habitué John Lydon wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words I Hate handwritten above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes  Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon to come to a nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook  According to Jones, He came in with green hair  I thought he had a really interesting face  I liked his look  He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins  John had something special, but when he started talking he was a real arsehole—but smart  When the pub closed, the group moved on to Sex, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper 's  I'm Eighteen  on the shop jukebox
